  "research_description": {
    "background": "Large fluctuations, instabilities, trends and uncertainty of financial markets constitute a substantial challenge for asset management companies, pension funds and regulators. Nowadays, most asset management companies and financial institutions follow a so-called systematic trading approach in their investment decisions. However, automated or rules-based trading activities bring certain risks for market participants and the whole financial market. In times of increased market volatility, market turmoil or so-called market sell-offs, investors applying similar trading rules might undertake the same actions, escalating and increasing systemic market risk.",
    "rationale": "Despite advancements in econometric methods, the detection of asset price bubbles and structural breaks remains uncertain and underexplored, particularly in the context of classic financial assets. Recent research underscores the powerful role of narratives in financial decision-making, suggesting that integrating textual analysis could enhance market understanding and prediction accuracy.",
    "overall_objectives": "Develop a comprehensive framework that utilizes advanced machine learning and NLP techniques to predict market outcomes, detect asset price bubbles, and identify structural breaks using diverse data sources, including financial data and narrative content from text, speech, and multimedia.",
    "specific_aims": [
      "Validate and refine existing econometric models using real-world financial data",
      "Integrate narrative analysis to understand and predict market behaviors and asset price dynamics",
      "Create a multidimensional AI and ML framework that enhances the detection of market anomalies and forecasts financial trends"
    ],
    "methods": "The approach involves collecting and processing a wide range of data, including stock prices, macroeconomic indicators, and textual content from the web. We employ text mining and NLP techniques to analyze sentiment, narrative structures, and their impact on market movements. Developing and testing new AI models that combine traditional financial analysis with narrative insights to predict market changes and detect structural breaks.",
    "expected_results": "Enhanced models for predicting financial markets with greater accuracy, especially in detecting asset price bubbles and structural breaks. Novel datasets and measurement techniques that provide deeper insights into the interplay between market narratives and financial indicators. Practical tools for asset management and regulatory bodies to better anticipate and react to market crises.",
    "impact": "This research aims to bridge the gap between traditional econometric approaches and modern AI techniques, providing new insights into the role of narratives and quantitative data in financial decision-making. The results offer valuable tools for risk management, asset pricing, and optimizing trading strategies, potentially influencing policy and regulatory practices globally."
