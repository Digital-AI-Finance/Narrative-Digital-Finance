<h3>Executive Summary</h3>

<p>This project successfully developed novel computational frameworks bridging narrative economics with financial market analysis. The research produced eight publications and preprints, six Zenodo-archived datasets and code repositories totaling over 600 MB of research outputs, established collaborations with industry partners including Deutsche Borse AG and Quoniam Asset Management, built a network spanning 49 countries with over 420 researchers, and completed all four work packages as defined in the original proposal. Key achievements include the TOPol framework for multidimensional semantic polarity analysis, macro-narrative integration combining macroeconomic indices with topic modeling for structural break detection, and HFT classification methodology measuring how rapidly information propagates through markets at nanosecond resolution. All research outputs are publicly available through Zenodo with persistent DOIs, enabling fully reproducible research in accordance with FAIR principles. The project extends narrative economics (Shiller 2017, 2019) with quantitative computational methods.</p>

<h2>1.1 Achievement of Research Objectives</h2>

<p>The project addressed three central research questions from the original proposal: (1) In what sense are financial markets ex-ante predictable through narrative analysis? (2) Is ex-ante forecastability persistent and applicable for real use cases? (3) How can structural break detection using narratives improve modern portfolio theory? We exceeded all objectives and achieved substantial progress across all four work packages.</p>

<h3>WP1: Text Data and Text Analytics</h3>

<p>We developed the TOPol framework, a semi-unsupervised approach for multidimensional semantic polarity using transformer embeddings, UMAP projection, and Leiden clustering. Unlike traditional unidimensional sentiment scoring, TOPol captures the full complexity of financial narratives through vectorial representation of polarity shifts. The framework embeds documents using transformer-based LLMs, applies neighbor-tuned UMAP projection, and segments via Leiden partitioning. Given regime boundaries, it computes directional vectors between topic-boundary centroids, producing polarity fields that capture semantic displacement. Additionally, we created an AI-enhanced systematic literature review methodology using NLP techniques, clustering algorithms, and interpretability tools, currently under revision at Financial Innovation (<a href="docs/preprint-SLR.pdf">preprint</a>). We developed a new methodology to quantify narratives in financial texts based on embeddings and zero-shot classification. Custom data pipelines were developed for RavenPack financial news, BIS central bank speeches, and SEC EDGAR 10-K/10-Q filings. To enable reproducible research, we released the BIS Central Banker Speeches Archive: a comprehensive 379 MB dataset containing worldwide central banker speeches from 1996-2025, collected via the BIS Gingado API using our open-source Python extraction script (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18034730">DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18034730</a> | <a href="docs/extract_speeches.py">Script</a> | <a href="docs/gigando-cb-speeches_1996-2025.csv">CSV</a>).</p>

<h3>WP2: Structural Breaks Detection and Asset Price Bubbles</h3>

<p>We developed the Macro Narratives Framework, which combines a PCA-based US Macro Strength Index using FED Funds Rate, CPI, PPI, GDP, Unemployment, and Nonfarm Payrolls from St. Louis FED FRED (1996-2025) with the PELT algorithm for change point detection. The first principal component captures joint dynamics in growth, inflation, and labor conditions. As validation, we applied the framework to Federal Reserve banker speech transcripts from BIS Gigando datasets (2004-2010) around the 2008 financial crisis, successfully identifying narrative shifts at detected breakpoints using BERTopic topic modeling. Null hypothesis testing via 1,000 random shuffling simulations validated statistical significance of observed polarity drift (FinBERT sentiment), semantic centroid movement (cosine similarity), and keyword evolution (Jaccard similarity of MMR sets). This research was presented as a poster at the Advances in Mathematical Finance conference at University of Freiburg in May 2025 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18167572">DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18167572</a> | <a href="docs/Poster_Macro_narratives.pdf">PDF</a>). The complete analysis pipeline and datasets are publicly available: the US Fed Speeches NER Dataset (206 MB parquet file with NER-tagged transcripts and macro sentiment scores), macroeconomic indicators (14 KB CSV), and two Jupyter notebooks for NER tagging and breakpoint detection analysis (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18157708">DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18157708</a> | <a href="docs/gigando_speech_NER.ipynb">NER Notebook</a> | <a href="docs/macroeconomic_narratives_breakpoints.ipynb">Breakpoints Notebook</a>). Additionally, we examined bubble formation in digital asset markets using supremum augmented Dickey-Fuller (SADF), generalized SADF (GSADF), and log-periodic power-law singularity (LPPLS) methods on NFT and DeFi indices, documenting recurrent explosive episodes clustering around the "DeFi Summer" of 2020, the crypto boom of early 2021, and the NFT bull run of late 2021. The bubble detection methodology and code are archived at Zenodo (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18154903">DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18154903</a> | <a href="papers/NFT_DeFi_Bubble_Detection.pdf">PDF</a>).</p>

<h3>WP3: Narratives for Structural Breaks</h3>

<p>We developed Python code and datasets for analyzing the effect of US central bank speeches on the macroeconomy. The methodology uses topic modeling to extract inflation narratives and constructs macroeconomic indices. We regress hawkish and dovish scores extracted from Federal Reserve communications against macro and inflation indices to quantify the relationship between central bank narrative tone and economic outcomes. In collaboration with Quoniam Asset Management, we extended this framework to practical portfolio applications, bridging academic research with institutional investment strategies. A key output of the Quoniam collaboration is the Evergreen Narratives Sentiments dataset: a 1.5 MB CSV file containing daily sentiment scores for "evergreen" financial narratives spanning from 2004 through mid-2025, computed using OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini model applied to US-filtered news headlines. This dataset enables researchers to study how persistent narrative themes evolve over time and correlate with market outcomes (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18036051">DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18036051</a> | <a href="docs/llm_narrative_sentiment_daily.csv">CSV</a>).</p>

<h3>WP4: Multidimensional AI and ML Solutions</h3>

<p>In collaboration with Deutsche Borse AG, we developed the HFT Market Microstructure framework, which measures how rapidly information propagates through financial markets at nanosecond resolution. Using nanosecond-level timestamp data from Deutsche Borse's T7 platform, the methodology classifies market participants by their reaction speed to information: Ultra-Fast Traders (UFT, less than 1 microsecond using FPGAs), High-Frequency Traders (HFT, 1-10 microseconds), and conventional participants (greater than 10 microseconds). Research documents participation shares showing UFT/HFT produce roughly 20% of total participation, price discovery via 15-second mark-out signal-to-noise ratio, and market quality metrics including order-imbalance volatility, Amihud illiquidity, and high-frequency return diagnostics for Euro STOXX 50 Index Futures from January to August 2025. This directly addresses the original research question of ex-ante predictability by quantifying how quickly narrative-driven information is incorporated into prices. The research was presented as a poster titled "From Speed to Stability: The Influence of Low Latency Trading on Market Quality" at QuantMinds International 2024 in London (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18167476">DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18167476</a> | <a href="docs/Poster_HFT_Impact_1.pdf">PDF</a>). A comprehensive preprint documenting nanosecond microstructure stylized facts has been submitted to SSRN (<a href="docs/HFT-stylized-facts.pdf">preprint</a>).</p>

<h2>1.2 Methodological Evolution and Outcomes</h2>

<h3>Data Infrastructure Evolution</h3>

<p>The original proposal envisioned Bloomberg and Refinitiv terminals as primary data sources. We developed custom data pipelines for alternative sources that proved more suitable: RavenPack for financial news headlines, BIS Gigando for worldwide central bank speeches, and Deutsche Borse for nanosecond-level trading data. These alternatives provide both rich textual narratives and precise market reaction timestamps unavailable through terminal-based access.</p>

<h3>HFT-Narrative Integration</h3>

<p>The Deutsche Borse collaboration initiated in January 2024 enabled a novel research stream: measuring how rapidly information propagates through financial markets. Access to proprietary nanosecond-level trading data from the T7 platform allowed classification of market participants by their reaction speed to information. This directly addresses the original research question of ex-ante predictability by quantifying how quickly narrative-driven information is incorporated into prices.</p>

<h3>Future Research Directions</h3>

<p>The computational frameworks developed enable several extensions. First, real-time narrative monitoring systems for live structural break detection, building on the post-ante validation demonstrated with the 2008 crisis case study. Second, cross-market narrative propagation analysis using the HFT classification methodology. Third, integration of the TOPol polarity fields with volatility regime detection through the PhD research in Stages 3-5, planned for 2026-2027.</p>

<h2>1.3 Contribution to Knowledge Advancement</h2>

<p>This research bridges narrative economics (Shiller, 2017, 2019) with computational linguistics and financial econometrics, providing quantitative tools for analyzing how narratives influence market dynamics. The work addresses a fundamental question: how do narrative forms influence volatility and regime changes in financial markets?</p>

<h3>TOPol Framework</h3>

<p>The TOPol framework represents the first semi-unsupervised framework for multidimensional semantic polarity in financial texts. Unlike traditional unidimensional sentiment scoring (positive/negative), TOPol captures narrative complexity through transformer embeddings for semantic representation, UMAP projection for dimensionality reduction, and Leiden clustering for topic segmentation. The vectorial representation enables quantification of magnitude, direction, and semantic meaning of polarity shifts across discourse regimes. The open source release at Zenodo enables replication and extension by the research community.</p>

<h3>Macro-Narrative Integration</h3>

<p>This novel methodology combines PCA-based macroeconomic indices (US Macro Strength Index from FRED data: FED Funds Rate, CPI, PPI, GDP, Unemployment, Nonfarm Payrolls) with BERTopic topic modeling for detecting narrative regime shifts at structural breakpoints. Null hypothesis testing via 1,000 random shuffling simulations provides rigorous statistical validation. The framework quantifies polarity drift using FinBERT sentiment, semantic centroid movement using cosine similarity, and keyword evolution using Jaccard similarity of MMR sets.</p>

<h3>HFT Classification and Narrative Propagation</h3>

<p>This new latency-based taxonomy measures narrative propagation speed through markets: UFT (less than 1 microsecond, FPGA-based), HFT (1-10 microseconds), and conventional participants (greater than 10 microseconds). The methodology was validated on Deutsche Borse T7 platform data with documented participation shares of approximately 20% UFT/HFT, price discovery metrics using 15-second mark-out signal-to-noise ratio, and market quality indicators including order-imbalance volatility and Amihud illiquidity. This methodology enables regulatory monitoring and market surveillance applications.</p>

<h3>Impact Areas</h3>

<p>The research contributes to Narrative Economics, Central Bank Communication Analysis, Market Microstructure, Volatility Regime Detection, NLP in Finance, High-Frequency Trading Research, Asset Bubble Detection, and Regulatory Technology (RegTech).</p>
