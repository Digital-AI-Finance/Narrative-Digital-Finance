         "Speech by the Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China, Mr. Chen Yuan, at the Bank of England Seminar held in London on 10/9/96.",
         "Mr.  Chen  discusses  monetary  relations  between  China  and  Hong  Kong Speech by the Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China, Mr. Chen Yuan, at the Bank of England Seminar held in London on 10/9/96.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nIn  less  than  three  hundred  days,  China  will  resume  the  exercise  of  sovereignty over Hong Kong. Given Hong Kong's role as an international financial centre, it is natural for the  international  investment  community  to  be  interested  in  the  future  of  Hong  Kong.  I  am grateful  to  Governor  George  for  giving  me  this  opportunity  to  share  with  this  distinguished audience the Chinese Government's policy on the monetary relationship between the mainland of China and Hong Kong after 1997.\n\nBy way of introduction, let me first explain the origin of the basic principle  of 'one  country,  two  systems',  which  forms  the  backbone  of  China's  policy  towards  the  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region as from 1 July 1997. This will help people to understand why China is so committed to implementing this very important principle in Hong Kong.\n\n## THE 'ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS' PRINCIPLE\n\nWhat  does  'one  country,  two  systems'  mean?  It  means  that  after  1997,  the socialist  system  and  policies  shall  not  be  practised  in  the  Hong  Kong  Special  Administrative Region, and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged for 50 years.\n\nThis  principle  was  not  a  compromise  solution  reached  in  the  Sino-British negotiations for political expedience. It was not even an idea floated by the British side. It was in fact  a  paramount  guiding  principle  adopted  by  the  Chinese  Government  for  advancing  the unification  of  China.  The  principle  was  also  the  outcome  of  intense  research  by  the  Chinese Government on what factors contributed to the economic success and stability of Hong  Kong and how they could be preserved beyond 1997. We are convinced that this principle would serve not only China's long-term national interest but also that of Hong Kong.\n\nIt  was  against  this  background  that  the  Chinese  Government  put  forward  in  the negotiations the concept of 'One Country, Two Systems' and the guiding principles. These were subsequently incorporated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration in  1984  and  then  in  the  Basic Law promulgated by our National People's Congress in 1990. I should add that the principle of 'one  country,  two  systems'  as  a  fundamental  policy  for  the  unification  and  development  of China  has  been  written  into  our  country's  constitution  and  become  a  long-term  irreversible national policy. The Sino-British Joint Declaration is a treaty registered with the United Nations. The Chinese Government is committed to implementing fully and faithfully the provisions of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.\n\nMy  second  point  is  that  notwithstanding  our  commitment,  there  is  no  lack  of sceptics who doubt that the Chinese Government would abide by the Basic Law and fulfil its commitments after 1997. This brings to mind those sceptics who doubted China's commitment to the open door policy and the economic reform which China initiated in late 1979. Such critics thought  that  the  problems  faced  by  China  in  the  reform  process  were  so  huge  that  we  were doomed to fail. They also doubted how our economic reform could square with China's socialist economy. Today, you and I can both see that these critics have been proven wrong.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1995, China's GDP has increased by an average of 9.9% every year  and  the  standard  of  living  has  improved  significantly.  The  economic  and  monetary conditions  and  the  legal  and  institutional  reform  of  our  financial  sector  have  made  progress beyond the expectations of many. China's foreign reserves reached a record high of US$ 90.7 billion in early August 1996.\n\nThe  critics  are  right  in  pointing  out  that  China  is  a  vast  country,  with  a  large population of over 1.2 billion people. It is natural that in the implementation of our reform we could run into difficulties of one sort or another. At times we need to adjust our pace a bit to resolve those problems but there is no question that China is firmly resolved to continuing with economic  reform.  Equally,  China  remains  firmly  and  totally  committed  to  maintaining  the prosperity  and  stability  of  Hong  Kong,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Joint Declaration  and  the  Basic  Law.  I  am  sure  that  the  facts  and  events  will  demonstrate  that  the sceptics will once again be proven to be wrong.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,  let  me  now  proceed  to  outline  first  the  legal  and  policy framework and then the seven basic principles governing the monetary relationship between the mainland  of  China  and  Hong  Kong.  Finally,  I  will  describe  China's  policy  on  Hong  Kong's participation in international and regional financial institutions and forums.\n\n## THE LEGAL AND POLICY FRAMEWORK\n\nAccording  to  the  Joint  Declaration  and  the  Basic  Law,  Hong  Kong  will  enjoy autonomy in all areas other than foreign affairs and defence matters. The key provisions on the monetary and financial sides provide that:\n\nThe Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall provide an  appropriate  economic  and  legal  environment  for  the  maintenance  of  its  status  as  an international  financial  centre.  Hong  Kong  shall,  on  its  own,  formulate  monetary  and  financial policies, safeguard the free operation of financial business and financial markets, and regulate and supervise financial activities in accordance with the law.\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar, as the only legal tender in Hong Kong, shall continue to circulate, and the existing currency issue mechanism shall continue. The Hong Kong dollar shall remain  freely  convertible,  with  free  flow  of  capital  and  no  exchange  controls.  The  Exchange Fund,  which  holds  Hong  Kong's  foreign  reserves,  shall  be  managed  and  controlled  by  the Government  of  the  Hong  Kong  Special  Administrative  Region,  primarily  for  regulating  the exchange value of the Hong Kong dollar.\n\nThe  above  provisions  form  the  foundation  for  defining  and  establishing  the monetary  relationship  between  the  mainland  and  Hong  Kong  under  the  principle  of  'one country, two systems'. Under these provisions, this relationship can be best summarised as one country,  two  currencies,  two  monetary  systems  and  two  monetary  authorities,  under  two different social and economic systems within a sovereign state.\n\n## SEVEN PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE MONETARY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MAINLAND AND HONG KONG\n\nI  will  now  set  out  the  seven  principles  governing  the  monetary  relationship between the mainland of China and Hong Kong.\n\nThe  first  principle  concerns  the  relationship  between  the  two  currencies  and between the two monetary systems.\n\nAccording to the Basic Law, Hong Kong will continue to maintain its own system of currency issuance and management after 1997. The Hong Kong dollar and the renminbi will circulate as legal tender in  Hong  Kong and the mainland respectively. The Hong Kong dollar will be treated as a foreign currency in the mainland. Likewise, the renminbi will be treated as a foreign currency in Hong Kong.\n\nThe  three  note-issuing  banks  in  Hong  Kong  will  continue  to  issue  Hong  Kong dollar bank notes, with 100% backing by US dollars under the linked exchange rate system. The currency in circulation in Hong Kong is in fact backed over five times by foreign reserves. Here I would like to stress that China supports Hong Kong's commitment to the maintenance of the linked exchange rate system, which has served Hong Kong well by providing monetary stability since its introduction in 1983.\n\nCorresponding to the two currencies will be two monetary systems. They possess their  own  characteristics,  reflecting  the  differences  between  the  two  economies.  The  two monetary systems are of equal importance to China in its reform and liberalisation. One does not precede or be subsidiary to the other. They will operate in a mutually independent manner.\n\nThe  second  principle  relates  to  the  relationship  between  the  two  monetary authorities. It follows from the two mutually independent monetary systems of the mainland and Hong  Kong  that  the  two  monetary  authorities  will  also  be  mutually  independent.  The  Hong Kong  Monetary  Authority  will  be  accountable  solely  to  the  Hong  Kong  government.  The People's Bank of China will not take the place of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and will not set up any office there.\n\nAs Hong Kong and the mainland develop increasingly close economic ties in both trade  and  investment,  close  co-operation  between  the  two  monetary  authorities  becomes  even more important.  The  two  monetary  authorities  must,  therefore,  strengthen  further  the  present sound  co-operation  of  central  banking  functions,  including  monetary  management,  banking supervision and the development of the financial infrastructure.\n\nThe third principle concerns co-operation in prudential supervision. According to the Basic Law, the Hong Kong government will continue to supervise financial institutions in Hong Kong, including financial institutions from the mainland. Supervision will continue to be undertaken in accordance with international rules and practices.\n\nNotwithstanding different business practices in the mainland and Hong Kong, we have  reached  consensus  on  licensing  procedures  and  supervision  of  each  other's  financial institutions. It has been agreed that :\n\nFinancial institutions based in the mainland and Hong Kong setting up offices in each other's territory shall be approved on the same basis as foreign financial institutions. The mainland  offices  of  Hong  Kong-based  financial  institutions  shall  continue  to  enjoy  the  same preferential treatment in the mainland as other foreign financial institutions. mainland financial institutions in Hong Kong shall not enjoy any privileges. They shall abide by the law of Hong Kong and be regulated by the relevant supervisory authorities in Hong Kong.\n\nThis arm's length treatment will certainly help to underscore the implementation of the 'one country, two systems' principle.\n\nThe fourth principle is that the People's Bank of China will support the currency stability  of  Hong  Kong.  On  behalf  of  the  PBOC,  I  have  early  this  year  signed  a  bilateral agreement with the HKMA on the repurchase of US treasury paper. We are prepared to offer liquidity  support  to  the  HKMA  for  the  purpose  of  stabilising  the  exchange  rate  of  the  Hong Kong dollar. We also stand ready to use our foreign reserves to support the Hong Kong dollar, if necessary.\n\nHowever, I  must  point  out  that  under  no  circumstances  will  China  draw  on  or resort  to  Hong  Kong's  Exchange  Fund  or  other  assets  in  any  way  and  for  any  reason.  I mentioned  earlier  that  the  Basic  Law  states  that  the  Exchange  Fund  shall  be  managed  and controlled  by  the  Hong  Kong  government.  It  is  also  stated  that  the  financial  revenues  of  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be used exclusively  for  its  own  purposes.  In addition,  the  Basic  Law  stipulates  that  the  Chinese  Government  shall  not  levy  taxes  in  Hong Kong. These triple safeguards are evidence that China does not have its eyes on siphoning off the resources of Hong Kong.\n\nThe  fifth  principle  relates  to  the  treatment  of  financial  business  between  China and Hong Kong. After 1997, all financial business between the two places will be conducted in accordance with the rules and practices of international financial activities. Claims and liabilities between banks and companies from the mainland and those in Hong Kong will continue to be regarded as external claims and liabilities. When raising funds in Hong Kong, Chinese entities will  have  equal  treatment  as  other  international  and  local  market  participants,  without  any special privileges. Disputes relating to contracts between banks and companies of the mainland and  those  of  Hong  Kong  shall  be  handled  in  accordance  with  international  practice.  Where China's  Arbitration  Law  and  other  relevant  laws  and  regulations  are  applied,  the  provisions relating to arbitration involving foreign parties will apply.\n\nThe  sixth  principle  is  about  the  standing  of  mainland  financial  institutions  in Hong Kong. As discussed earlier, mainland financial institutions in Hong Kong must abide by the law of Hong Kong and be regulated by relevant regulatory authorities there. I would like to stress  that  the  Bank  of  China  group,  though  being  one  of  the  three  note-issuing  banks  and  a leading commercial bank in Hong Kong, shall not be treated more favourably than other banks. It shall not carry out any activities beyond the role of a commercial bank.\n\nThe  seventh  principle  is  on  the  complementarity  between  Shanghai  and  Hong Kong.  As  you  know,  Shanghai  used  to  be  China's  financial  centre.  With  China's  deepening reforms and open-door policy, Shanghai is becoming a vibrant city with tremendous potential for  further  development.  To  a  certain  extent,  Shanghai  has  met  the  conditions  for  reviving herself as a financial centre. While there are concerns as to whether Shanghai will replace Hong Kong, I would like to emphasise that these are groundless speculations because the Basic Law has  already  stipulated  that  Hong  Kong  shall  maintain  its  status  as  an  international  financial centre.\n\nWe are of the view that Hong Kong and Shanghai will have a complementary and mutually  reinforcing  relationship.  In  the  short  run,  and  at  least  before  the  renminbi  becomes fully convertible, it will not be possible for Shanghai to become an international financial centre. Given the size of China's economy, there is plenty of room for more than one financial centre.\n\nHong  Kong  and  Shanghai  will  likely  become  two  complementary  and  mutually  reinforcing financial centres that will each develop with its own characteristics.\n\n## HONG KONG IN INTERNATIONAL MONETARY RELATIONS\n\nApart  from  these  seven  principles,  it  is  also  important  for  Hong  Kong  as  an international  financial  centre  to  continue  to  develop  its  international  monetary  relations  and participate  in  the  activities  of  international  and  regional  financial  institutions,  central  bank forums etc.\n\nThere  are  therefore  provisions  in  the  Joint  Declaration  and  the  Basic  Law  that Hong  Kong  may,  on  its  own,  maintain  and  develop  financial  relations  and  conclude  and implement  agreements  with  other  countries,  regions  and  relevant  international  organisations, using the name of 'Hong Kong, China'.\n\nSome international financial organisations restrict their membership to sovereign states. In those cases, where negotiations are held on matters involving Hong Kong, the Chinese Government would normally consult Hong Kong and include its representatives in the Chinese delegation.  When  entering  into  international  financial  agreements  which  may  involve  Hong Kong, the Chinese government will first seek the views of Hong Kong before deciding whether such agreements will apply to it.\n\nTaken  together,  these  provisions  will  enable  Hong  Kong  to  continue  and  also develop its current international monetary relationship.\n\n## PROSPECTS FOR HONG KONG AFTER 1997\n\nI believe Hong Kong will remain prosperous and stable after 1997. Why? This is because:\n\nFirst,  the  strong  economic  fundamentals  of  Hong  Kong  and  the  entrepreneurial and management skills of the people of Hong Kong are the basis for its continued prosperity and stability.\n\nSecondly, the Basic Law has provided a legal safeguard for the maintenance of the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.\n\nThirdly,  the  economic  development  of  the  mainland  has  created  excellent conditions for Hong Kong's continued prosperity and stability. As pointed out by China's VicePremier  Zhu  Rongji  at  his  meeting  on  29  May  this  year  with  senior  officials  of  four  main financial  regulators  and  institutions  from  Hong  Kong  including  the  Hong  Kong  Monetary Authority - China is confident in Hong Kong's maintaining prosperity and stability and its status as an international financial centre after 1997 because we have full confidence in the economic development of China.\n\nAs Hong Kong will continue its role as an international financial centre, it will become the most important funding centre for China and very likely for the Asian region as a whole.  With  the  ongoing  reform  and  open-door  policy,  the  mainland  of  China  has  achieved sustained and  strong  economic  growth.  Our  target  for  economic  growth  in  1996  is  8%  but  it could exceed 9%. Inflation should be within the range of 7 to 8% for 1996.\n\nThe mainland of China's growth will  obviously  benefit  Hong  Kong's  economy tremendously  as  we  are  its  largest  trading  partner.  The  mainland  of  China  is  also  one  of  the leading investors in Hong Kong, with total investment reaching US$ 25 billion last year. At the same  time,  Hong  Kong  has  also  contributed  greatly  to  the  mainland  of  China's  reform  and modernisation, both in terms of investment and know-how. Hong Kong is the largest investor in the mainland. Total cumulative direct investment from Hong Kong has now reached US$ 78.6 billion, accounting for 58% of total foreign direct investment. In 1995 alone, about half of the foreign direct investment in the mainland came from Hong Kong, which amounted to some US$ 20 billion. Also, for the 23 Chinese companies listed on overseas stock markets, the trading of such  overseas  stocks  is  most  active  in  Hong  Kong.  Out  of  the  23  companies,  21  had  their primary listing in Hong Kong.\n\nAs China continues with its financial and economic reforms, Hong Kong's role as a  financial  centre  for  China  will  become  even  more  important.  It  is  therefore  vital  that  Hong Kong remain the vibrant financial centre with its own economic system that we know now. We certainly would not do anything which would jeopardise Hong Kong's prospects.\n\nTo conclude, I have no doubt that Hong Kong will continue to do well after 1997 as it has done in  the  past  three  decades  during  which  Hong  Kong  survived  numerous  shocks  and  market turbulence. History has shown that Hong Kong has been extremely resilient to external shocks and  was  able  to  regain  its  vitality  and  competitiveness  through  swift  internal  adjustments. Investors who had the foresight and wisdom of capitalising on the opportunities in Hong Kong have done well and will be able to continue to share in the prosperity of Hong Kong.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, 1997 is not a time when Hong Kong will need a miracle in order  to  survive  the  transition.  I  hope  you  will  also  come  to  the  conclusion  that  China, particularly  Hong  Kong,  offers  tremendous  business  potential  for  investors,  both  local  and overseas.\n\nBIS Review   12/1997",

         "Speech by the Governor of the People's Bank of China, Mr. Dai Xianglong, at the luncheon hosted by the Hong Kong Financial Secretary in Washington on 30/9/96.",
         "Mr.  Dai  assesses  the  outlook  for  Hong  Kong  as  Asia's  financial  centre Speech by the Governor  of  the  People's  Bank  of  China,  Mr.  Dai  Xianglong,  at  the  luncheon hosted by the  Hong Kong Financial Secretary in Washington on 30/9/96.\n\nThe  1997  World  Bank/IMF  Annual  Meetings  will  be  held  in  Hong  Kong  next year. Mr Liu Zhongli, the Minister of Finance and myself will be there welcoming you as the host  of  the  occasion.  I  foresee  that  the  Annual  Meetings  to  be  held  next  year  will  be  a magnificent  event  which  commands  far-reaching  historical  significance.  This  is  because  the Annual  Meetings  of  the  two  important  international  financial  organisations  are  to  be  held  in Hong Kong just a few months after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. Representatives from various countries will have the opportunity to witness the realisation of the principle of 'one country, two systems' in Hong Kong. I believe that nobody will wish to miss such an opportunity.\n\nMr Tsang has just expressed his views on the economy of Hong Kong before and after 1997. I would like to say a few words from the perspective of the People's Bank of China (PBOC). I have stated  on  many  occasions  that  we  are  confident  that  after  China  resumes  the exercise  of  sovereignty  over  Hong  Kong,  the  territory  will  not  only  remain  prosperous  and stable, but its status as an international financial centre will also be further enhanced.\n\nAnd I have good reasons for this confidence.\n\nFirst,  there  are  the  strong  economic  fundamentals  of  Hong  Kong  and  the entrepreneurial and management skills of the people of Hong Kong. These form the basis for Hong Kong's continued prosperity and stability and for maintaining Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.\n\nAs  you  all  know,  Hong  Kong  is  an  international  trade,  transport,  financial  and information  centre.  With  the  rapid  economic  developments  taking  place  in  the  Asia-Pacific region, Hong Kong's role as an international financial centre will not be weakened; instead, its importance will certainly increase. According to the 'Joint Declaration of the Government of the United  Kingdom  of  Great  Britain  and  Northern  Ireland  and  the  Government  of  the  People's Republic  of  China  on  the  Question  of  Hong  Kong'  and  'The  Basic  Law  of  the  Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China', Hong Kong will become a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China from 1 July 1997. It will enjoy a high degree of autonomy with Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong. Hong Kong will become an independent tariff and trade region and an international financial centre in China but with its own currency. In order to maintain its status as an international financial centre, Hong Kong will inevitably  face  various  challenges.  However,  Hong  Kong  will  continue  to  have  a  sound  legal system,  advanced  communication  facilities  and  infrastructures,  professional  and  management expertise, and strong foreign reserves. Currently, Hong Kong's foreign reserves rank seventh in the world while China's rank second. With the backing of such strong economic strength, we are confident that  Hong Kong's status  as  an  international  financial  centre  will  be  maintained  and further enhanced.\n\nSecondly,  from  the  legal  angle,  the  Basic  Law  assures  the  continuation  and enhancement of Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.\n\nArticles  109  to  113  of  the  Basic  Law  lay  down  specific  provisions  relating  to Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre, its monetary and financial policies, the status of the Hong Kong dollar and the issuing arrangements, capital movements and the role of\n\nthe  Exchange Fund. These principles establish the basic monetary relationship  between  China and Hong Kong under the principle of 'one country, two systems', and this can conveniently be summarised  as  'one  country,  two  currencies,  two  monetary  systems  and  two  monetary authorities'  within  a  sovereign  state.  It  should  be  pointed  out  that  the  co-existence  of  two currencies,  that  is,  the  Hong  Kong  dollar  and  the  renminbi,  is  a  clear  demonstration  of  the differences between the economies of Hong Kong and the mainland. It is therefore essential that the two monetary systems should be mutually independent. The renminbi will not replace the Hong  Kong  dollar.  We  are  of  the  view  that  the  co-existence  of  two  monetary  systems  is significant to the economic reform of China.\n\nIt follows from the two mutually independent monetary systems of the mainland and Hong Kong that the two monetary authorities will also be mutually independent and one is not  superior  to  the  other.  The  Hong  Kong  Monetary  Authority  (HKMA)  will  be  accountable solely  to  the  Hong  Kong  Special  Administrative  Region  Government  from  1  July  1997.  The PBOC will not take the place of the HKMA and will not set up any branch office in Hong Kong.\n\nI am glad that international organisations and other central banks also acknowledge the mutually independent relationship between the PBOC and the HKMA.\n\nBoth  the  PBOC  and  the  HKMA  were  offered  membership  in  the  Bank  for International  Settlements  in  early  September  this  year.  This  shows  that  the  work  done  by  the PBOC and the HKMA are widely accepted and appreciated by the central  banking  fraternity. This also shows that the international financial community fully supports the principle of 'one country, two systems' laid down by the Basic Law.\n\nThe  Basic  Law  also  states  that  the  Exchange  Fund  shall  be  managed  and controlled  by  the  Hong  Kong  government.  It  also  states  that  the  revenues  of  the  Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region shall be used exclusively for its own purposes. In addition, the Basic  Law  stipulates  that  the  Chinese  Government  will  not  levy  taxes  in  Hong  Kong.  These three-fold  safeguards  are  evidence  that  China  will  not  interfere  with  Hong  Kong's  financial matters. We have reiterated time and again that under no circumstances will China draw on or resort  to  Hong  Kong's  Exchange  Fund  or  other  assets  in  any  way  or  for  any  reason.  On  the contrary,  the  PBOC  will  support  the  currency  stability  of  Hong  Kong.  The  PBOC  and  the HKMA entered into a bilateral agreement on repurchase of US treasury paper early this year. We also stand ready to provide funds to support the Hong Kong dollar, if necessary.\n\nThirdly,  the  economic  development  of  the  mainland  has  created  excellent conditions for the continuity and further strengthening of Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. Economic development in the  mainland  provides  a  strong  support  to  Hong  Kong's  economic development. China is confident in Hong Kong's maintaining prosperity and stability after 1997 because we have full confidence in the economic development in China.\n\nChina  is  firmly  committed  to  continuing  with  its  economic  reform  and  our achievements are widely recognised. Currently, the macro-economic situation in mainland China is steady. The various macro-economic indicators do meet our targets laid down early this year and some even out-perform our expectations. It is anticipated that this year's economic growth will be around 9%. The retail price is expected to rise by about 7% and is expected to remain steady over the next two years or may even ease further. At present, our foreign reserves  are over US$ 90 billion and are expected to exceed US$ 95 billion by the end of this year. Since the beginning of the second quarter this year, external trade has posted some steady growth. There is a significant inflow of capital and our balance of payments is in a healthy position. Therefore the\n\nexchange  rate  of  the  renminbi,  which  is  determined  by  the  market,  will  remain  stable.  The renminbi, for all intents and purposes has become fully convertible in the current account. We are in advance of our schedule in satisfying the requirement stipulated in Article VIII of the IMF Articles of Agreement.\n\nIn  the  next  five  years,  China  will  continue  to  adopt  an  appropriately  tight monetary policy. The adoption of this policy means firstly, we will have an appropriately tight monetary stance to keep inflation at a level lower than the rate of economic growth. Secondly, money supply should grow at an appropriate level. In the next five years, the annual growth rate of M1 will be kept at around 18% and M2 at 21% to 23%. Thirdly, reforms and improvements will continuously be made to the approach in making macro-economic adjustment. That is, we will  move  from  reliance  on  direct  control  of  the  volume  of  credit  towards  regulating  money supply  by  means  of  indirect  monetary  policy  instruments  such  as  reserve  requirements,  open market operations and interest rate policy. Appropriately tight monetary policy is not limited to the  control  of  total  credit  but  also  adjustment  of  the  credit  structure,  deepening  of  monetary reforms, and timely adjustments to the different aspects of the monetary  system.  An appropriately tight monetary policy is conducive to the healthy, stable and sustained growth of the  national  economy.  It  also  helps  to  create  favourable  conditions  for  the  resumption  of sovereignty and the continued prosperity of Hong Kong.\n\nStability in China is the very basis for Hong Kong's stability while Hong Kong's stability will certainly enhance economic reform and developments in China. Foreign investors in Hong Kong will, at the same time, benefit from the stability of China and Hong Kong.\n\nThose sceptics who have doubted China's commitment to the open door policy no longer can have such doubts after witnessing the implementation of our economic reforms and its achievements. I hope you will recognise that China is firmly committed to implementing the principle  of  'one  country,  two  systems'  and  maintaining  the  prosperity  and  stability  of  Hong Kong,  just  as  we  have  been  firmly  committed  to  the  implementation  of  economic  reform  in China.  The  principle  of  'one  country,  two  systems'  is  the  realisation  of  the  spirit  of  our constitution  and  has  become  a  long-term  irreversible  national  policy.  As  China  continues  to pursue its economic reform, Hong Kong's role as the international financial centre in China will become more and more important. We will do our best to help maintain the existing economic system of Hong Kong and keep up its economic dynamism. We also hope that the international financial community will join us in our efforts to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, when you come to next year's Annual Meetings in Hong Kong, you will all  see  for  yourselves  the  realisation  of  the  principle  of  'one  country,  two  systems'  in  Hong Kong.  In  addition,  I  believe  that  the  1997  World  Bank/IMF  Annual  Meetings  will  be  an impressive event as a result.",

         "Mr. Matsushita considers the role of monetary policy in Japan Translated excerpts of a speech given by the Governor of the Bank of Japan, Mr. Yasuo Matsushita, at the Research Institute of Japan in Tokyo on 06/11/96.\n\n## I. Introduction\n\nI am greatly honored to have been invited by the Research Institute of Japan to address this distinguished audience.\n\nToday, I would first like to discuss the Bank of Japan's views on recent economic developments in Japan and the thinking behind the Bank's current monetary policy. Then, I would like to review some of the basic issues related to monetary policy management, such as the significance of price stability, which is the objective of monetary policy, and the points for consideration in achieving it.\n\nThere has been much debate since the beginning of this year about Japan's central bank system, and the Central Bank Study Group, an advisory panel to the Prime Minister, is planning to publish a report in the near future. I myself have, on several occasions, addressed the basic issues involved, such as the status of the central bank within the framework of a democratic society, and the role of the central bank in maintaining financial system stability. | As my previous speeches focused on the institutional framework of central banking, there has not been an opportunity to discuss the Bank of Japan's views on the central bank's policy management.\n\nI have thus selected monetary policy as the theme of today's speech. However, there is another reason. Over the past decade, it seems that a new thinking has been developing among the industrialized countries regarding monetary and fiscal policy management, or more broadly, the economic policy management of a country. This has prompted heated discussions in various countries in recent years on monetary policy and central banking, and this new thinking will be of great significance in contemplating the future framework of the Japanese economy. I would therefore like to examine the role of monetary policy, bearing in mind this new thinking on economic policy management.\n\n## II. Domestic Economic Conditions and Current Monetary Policy\n\n## A. Domestic Economic Conditions\n\nI would like to begin by reviewing domestic economic conditions. In spring 1995, the recovery of the Japanese economy came to a pause and, at one time, there were even concerns about a deflationary spiral. In view of these economic developments, substantial monetary easing and large-scale fiscal policy measures were implemented. Since the beginning of this year, the economy has once again been on a recovery path, owing to the permeation of policy effects and the depreciation of the yen. The Bank currently judges that a moderate economic recovery continues, but there are concerns as to why the economy has not shown a recovery that is any stronger than \"moderate\" for nearly a year.\n\nThis slow recovery can be explained by the tug-of-war between the forces encouraging recovery and the structural adjustment pressures constraining recovery. Therefore,\n\n'For details, see previous speeches entitled \"The role of the Central Bank\" and \"Recent Monetary and Economic Conditions and Issues facing the Japanese Financial System\", given on 14/06/96 and 03/04/96, respectively. Both speeches are included in the August 1996 issue of the Bank of Japan Quarterly Bulletin.\n\nto predict future economic developments, we must first understand how these two factors are at work in the economy.\n\nOne of the forces encouraging recovery is the permeation of policy effects. For example, there is no doubt that the decline in interest rates has been contributing significantly to the recovery in housing and business fixed investments. At the same time, fiscal expenditures have underpinned domestic aggregate demand. However, forces encouraging economic recovery are not limited to the supporting policy measures. As the economy follows a recovery path supported by policy effects, a larger number of firms with improving profits have begun to show a more positive stance toward business fixed investment and employment. As a result, the risk of a deflationary spiral, which was an issue of concern last year, has been practically eliminated. It can thus be said that the cyclical forces of the economy based on domestic private demand have been slowly but steadily at work for the past year.\n\nHowever, the factors that constrain economic recovery have also been persistent. For example, while business fixed investment continues to recover owing to progress in capital stock adjustment, it has not yet gained the full momentum seen in past economic recoveries. This is because firms, in spite of improved profits, have given priority to repaying debts in order to improve their balance sheets, or have limited their gross fixed investment to the amount of cash flow generated from depreciation of existing facilities.\n\nIntensified competition with other Asian countries, which has brought changes to the international environment, is also affecting the Japanese economy in various ways. The inflow of low-priced goods from other Asian countries, for example, seriously affects firms producing competing products. Furthermore, the relocation of production bases overseas by Japanese manufacturers not only decreases domestic business fixed investment by those manufacturers, but also restrains the investment by their domestic subcontractors, due to decrease in orders. It seems that management of firms have not been able to dispel uncertainties over the future, as the path toward a new industrial structure remains obscure under the current circumstances.\n\n## B. Structural Adjustment Pressures\n\nThe Japanese economy is thus faced with two types of adjustment pressures: pressures for balance-sheet adjustment in the corporate sector; and pressures for structural adjustment of the industries created by the intensifying competition with other Asian countries. These are the factors that have caused the pace of economic recovery to remain moderate. These two adjustment pressures are, however, significantly different in nature.\n\nAdjustment of balance sheets is about reducing debts which accumulated during the \"bubble\" period, in other words, disposing of the burdens from the past. To that extent, this adjustment is regrettably of a negative nature.\n\nIn order to reduce the burdens, it will be necessary to enhance the functions of the capital markets to strengthen firms' capital bases, and to revitalize the real estate market to facilitate the liquidation of firms' real estate holdings. Ultimately, however, it is only increase in profits that provides the funds necessary to write off latent losses on real estate and repay accumulated loans. In other words, the burdens from the past need to be reduced gradually with each year's income arising from economic activity.\n\nIn this regard, although it may sound paradoxical, revitalizing economic activity and boosting corporate profits, or more fundamentally, supporting the recovery of the economy will be important preconditions for the smooth progress of balance-sheet adjustment. Realizing a recovery of the economy encumbered with impaired balance sheets, therefore, requires a stronger policy support than otherwise. This is one of the reasons why the Bank has implemented substantial monetary easing measures to date.\n\nAs a result, the economy has resumed recovery, although moderate, and corporate profits have been increasing. Accordingly, balance sheets have also been improving gradually. Regarding debt servicing ability, the ratio of firms' long-term debts to cash flow has been declining slowly for the past two years, after rising rapidly during the \"bubble\" period. It can be said that firms' balance sheets have, in general, begun to show steady improvement, although differences remain between individual sectors and firms.\n\nWhile the balance-sheet adjustment is an attempt to recover from a negative situation, structural adjustment of the industries in response to a new global economic environment is essentially a positive challenge in that the restructuring process itself introduces the possibility of creating renewed economic development.\n\nThe increasing supply capacity of other East Asian economies and\\_ their transition to market economies have intensified competition facing Japan's labor-intensive sectors. At the same time, however, these factors have expanded markets and business opportunities for the Japanese economy. Therefore, if the Japanese economy can adapt itself successfully to this new international division of labor, these developments should bring significant benefits to the Japanese economy in the long run.\n\nIn fact, a careful look at the Japanese economy will reveal indications of such positive industrial restructuring. The change in Japan's trade structure is one example. Until a decade ago, the top five imports were mostly fuels and raw materials, usually crude oil, wood, petroleum products, coal, and natural gas, although the order varied from year to year. In 1995, however, while crude oil maintained its top position, the other four major imports were office machinery, electronic parts, automobiles, and wood. The share of manufactured goods in Japan's total imports has doubled from 30 to 60 percent over the decade. This change by itself would merely suggest that the manufacturing sector, which had long been Japan's mainstay, now faces severer competition with imported goods. What is notable is that the composition of exports has also changed significantly during the same period. Automobiles, ships, and household electric appliances such as television sets and radios used to appear at the top of the list of export items. In 1995, however, while automobiles stayed as the number one import, electronic parts, office machinery, automobile parts, and scientific and optical apparatus ranked second to fifth, indicating that capital goods and parts have replaced consumer durables.\n\nAs labor-intensive sectors such as the consumer durables industry grow in other East Asian economies, exports of labor-intensive products from Japan have been declining, while those of capital-intensive products with higher value added, such as capital goods and related parts, have been increasing. This is a typical illustration of the Japanese economy's strong ability to adapt to changes in the global environment.\n\nThe emergence and expansion of new leading industries in Japan are also indications of industrial restructuring. The mobile telecommunications market, for example, has grown rapidly to a ¥3.5 trillion market and the business fixed investment of this industry has expanded to almost ¥2 trillion, which is equivalent to the sum of business fixed investment by the automobile and iron-and-steel industries. Furthermore, in these three years when economic recovery has been unable to obtain a firm footing, some industries achieved earnings growth comparable to or even exceeding that attained in the three years during the economic boom of the latter half of the 1980s: namely, the electrical and precision machinery industries, which have succeeded in adjusting to the new international division of labor; and the pulp and paper industry in the raw materials sector, which has been able to benefit from the increased volume of information processed and distributed in today's technological age.\n\nI have so far emphasized the brighter side of the domestic economy with the hope of further encouraging the efforts of domestic industries, but reality is obviously not so simple. During periods of transition of industrial structure, the contrast between the bright and dark sides tends to become stronger. Focusing on the dark side, the mismatch between labor\n\nsupply and demand has become greater, and restructuring burdens have been particularly heavy on small and medium-sized firms.\n\nLooking back at the postwar period, the Japanese economy successfully underwent several major changes in the industrial structure and shifts in leading industries. There is no doubt that during the periods of transition, management of firms faced great uncertainties about the future, and that it was extremely difficult to accurately predict which would be the growth industries in the coming years. However, during the era of high economic growth, the rapid expansion of the economy absorbed the negative impact arising from the structural adjustment of the industries. The main difficulty that the current economy faces seems to lie not in the industrial restructuring itself, but in the fact that the current economic growth is not strong enough to provide a similar \"shock absorber\" effect.\n\nFor this reason the implementation of structural policy, such as deregulation, has become an urgent issue. In order to promote industrial restructuring, it is necessary to create new investment opportunities and to encourage unrestricted and creative business activity through deregulation. It is also important to increase labor mobility and facilitate land transactions.\n\n## C. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Management\n\nIn order for the Japanese economy to be put firmly on a self-sustaining recovery path in the face of reduced fiscal support, it will be necessary for the structural adjustment to continue to progress and for the virtuous circle between production, income, and expenditure to gain further strength. In this respect, firms have been responding steadily to the structural adjustment pressures. The decline in net exports, which had been a drag on economic recovery, has been slowing recently. In addition, inventory adjustment, which has been under way in certain sectors since this spring, has virtually been completed in the iron-and steel-industry.\n\nIn light of these facts, it is most likely that production will be further revitalized, strengthening the virtuous circle of the economy led by expanded private demand. However, this remains to be seen.\n\nIn view of this economic situation, the Bank will continue, in the management of current monetary policy, to monitor monetary and economic developments closely, placing emphasis on further strengthening the foundation for an economic recovery. And to repeat my earlier point, it is also important to carry out structural reforms including drastic deregulation. In this respect, I hope that the new administration will continue to exercise strong leadership.\n\n## I. New Thinking on Economic Policy Management\n\nThe industrialized countries today attach more importance to structural policies, such as the strengthening of the competitiveness of domestic industries and the improvement of market infrastructure. In addition, these countries are making steady efforts to promote fiscal consolidation, to reform their central bank systems, and more broadly, to review national economic policy management and its framework.\n\nThis common trend among the industrialized countries is closely related to the recent changes in the global economy. The collapse of the former socialist bloc, for example, demonstrated the superiority of a market economy over a government-controlled economy: that is, the superiority of a decentralized economy over a centrally-planned economy. In addition, the transition to a market economy and the progress of industrialization of these former socialist countries and the developing Asian countries have stimulated the industrialized countries to strengthen the competitiveness of their economies.\n\nFurthermore, past experiences of economic fluctuations, such as inflation and the asset-price \"bubble\", and the concurrent accumulation of budget deficits have prompted countries to closely re-examine fundamental thinking on economic policy and the underlying economic theories. This year happens to be the 50th year since the death of John Maynard Keynes. There have recently been renewed discussions on the evaluating of Keynes' theories and Keynesian economics, which in many respects formed the basis of postwar economic policies.\n\nThe approaches currently adopted by various countries in addressing economic policies have several points in common.\n\nThe first point is the growing emphasis placed on improving the supply side of the economy. The conventional approach to economic policy emphasizes the control of aggregate demand through monetary and fiscal policies, and this remains dominant when seeking short-term adjustments of the economy. At the same time, however, there is a growing perception that the driving force of long-term economic growth owes much to firms' efforts to improve their productivity. It is thus necessary to strengthen the supply side of the economy by promoting the introduction of new technology and by improving infrastructures such as transportation and telecommunications.\n\nIn fiscal policy management, greater importance is being attached to the details of fiscal expenditures from the viewpoint of evaluating the contribution of each portion to the improvement of economic infrastructures, rather than to their effects in generating additional demand. There is also a stronger awareness that, in the medium to long term, it is more desirable to curtail inefficient fiscal expenditures thereby reducing budget deficits and to utilize economic resources more efficiently in the private sector. All this reflects the growing emphasis on the supply side of the economy.\n\nThe second point in common in the approaches to addressing economic policies is the emphasis placed on the utilization of the market mechanism. Related to the first point, it can be said that this emphasis calls for fully utilizing the inherent forces of the market mechanism of promoting greater economic efficiency and of inducing technological innovation, in order to achieve higher productivity.\n\nThe global trend toward deregulation and promotion of market competition obviously originates in this common thinking. The effectiveness of the market mechanism is not limited to revitalization of industries and improvement of financial markets. For example, in Europe, there is a growing understanding that the main cause of the high unemployment rate, which has persisted for some time, is the lack of mobility in the labor markets. The solution to the problem, therefore, is considered to lie in facilitating the mobility in the labor markets so as to efficiently adjust labor market conditions.\n\nThe third common element is the growing emphasis placed on the public's expectations regarding future developments and its confidence in economic policies. For example, the effectiveness of fiscal policy depends significantly on the public's views on the controllability of the fiscal deficits in the future. In the European countries and the United States, there is a growing perception that doubts about a government's ability to control budget deficits could bring about an unfavorable rise in long-term interest rates. This is one of the major reasons why fiscal consolidation is considered to be an important task.\n\nIt has also become clear that changes in expectations regarding price and interest rate developments significantly influence the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\nThere is a theory which even suggests that discretionary economic policy would not have any effect if people always had rational expectations about the future. While this may be an extreme example, in general it has come to be considered that the efficacy of economic policy cannot be discussed without taking into account its effects on people's expectations.\n\nThese recent changes in the thinking on economic policy naturally have a close bearing on the fundamental thinking about central banking and monetary policy management.\n\nFor example, even when implementing short-term demand management policy, it is necessary to ensure that the policy is compatible with the objective of price stability --the medium to long-term objective of monetary policy and a precondition for the smooth functioning of the market mechanism. It is also necessary to ensure that the public's confidence in monetary policy be strengthened by clearly establishing the independence and accountability of the central bank. Bearing these points in mind, I would now like to move on to the other theme of today's speech, the fundamental issues concerning monetary policy management.\n\n## IV. The Basic Thinking on Monetary Policy Management\n\n## A. Price Stability and the Central Bank\n\nMost people agree that the objective of monetary policy is the maintenance of price stability. I would like to explain why it is that this particular economic policy objective, among others, is assigned to monetary policy.\n\nPrice stability, in this context, is not necessarily the stability of prices of individual goods and services, in other words, the stability of relative prices of individual items. In fact, fluctuation of relative prices in response to changes in the supply and demand conditions reflects the most basic principle of the market mechanism. Central banks aim at achieving the stability of prices in general by taking the prices of individual items in their totality. If prices in general increase, that is, if inflation occurs, the amount of goods that can be purchased for ¥10,000 will decrease, which means that the value of ¥10,000 will decline. It can thus be said that \"prices in general\" is another way of expressing \"currency value\". The maintenance of price stability naturally becomes one of the most important missions of the central bank as the issuer of the currency, together with the mission of maintaining the stability of the financial system.\n\nMoreover, in the long run, it is the monetary policy of the central bank that is able to most effectively achieve stability of prices in general. It is true that prices, in the short term, fluctuate due to various factors: overseas market prices, such as crude oil prices; or the supply and demand conditions of particular goods. However, from a longer-term perspective, prices in general are determined by the amount of money relative to the amount of traded goods and services. For this reason inflation is often said to be a monetary phenomenon, and the task of achieving price stability is necessarily assigned to monetary policy. This then explains why the monetary policy of the central bank is so vital and why the central bank is called the guardian of the currency.\n\nThere is a question of how asset prices, such as land prices and stock prices, may be considered in the management of monetary policy. The Bank believes that it is unsuitable to consider asset prices in the same way as it does the prices of ordinary goods and services. For example, land is not produced by everyday economic activity. In addition, land prices are determined in part by the perception of earnings that will be generated from the land, in other words, by the projection of economic activity and prices. Asset prices are therefore different in nature from the prices of goods and services that are produced daily through economic activity and consumed. It is also apparent, however, from the bitter experiences of the \"bubble\" economy that major fluctuations in asset prices are related to large swings in the economy. Therefore, the Bank believes that in order to ensure price stability in the medium to long term, due attention must be paid to asset-price developments. Later, I would like to discuss in more detail the meaning of price stability in the medium to long term.\n\n## B. The Significance of Price Stability\n\nLet me now consider the significance of price stability. It seems self-evident that inflation and deflation are not desirable. As large fluctuations in prices are usually accompanied by economic overheating or recession, the stabilization of prices will lead to a stable economy. Furthermore, price fluctuations lead to an uneven distribution of income and assets, thereby threatening the stability of people's everyday lives.\n\nIn addition to the above, I would like to stress that the stability of prices in general is the most important precondition for the smooth functioning of the market mechanism. The market mechanism adjusts production and demand according to the signals sent by the changes in relative prices. Once inflation or deflation occurs, it becomes extremely difficult to read the signals received from the changes in individual prices, and as a result, the price mechanism ceases to function properly. This is because it becomes impossible to distinguish whether changes in individual prices reflect shifts in relative prices or in prices in general. It is as if there is no reliable yardstick for economic activity. Under such circumstances, firms trying to formulate future business plans based on their estimation of profitability of investments, and households making plans for savings and consumption face growing uncertainties, and this impedes economic development.\n\nIn the past, some argued that inflation is desirable to a certain extent in order to further stimulate economic growth, or that firms' activities would become more vigorous under inflation. The 50 years of postwar experience and the evolution of economic theories, however, have forced serious reconsideration of this argument. There is every likelihood that a mild inflation will eventually lead to full-scale inflation. In addition, once inflation takes root, the achievements of business activity are masked by nominal increases in profits, and accordingly, technological innovation and improvement in productivity are likely to be discouraged. Actual examples demonstrate that, from a longer-term perspective, countries with stable prices tend to enjoy higher economic growth.\n\nFor these reasons, the current emphasis is on the significance of price stability, which is in line with the global trend in economic policy management placing stronger emphasis on the supply side of the economy and on the utilization of the market mechanism.\n\n## C. The Meaning of Price Stability and Assessment Criteria\n\nHow can price stability be defined? This remains a difficult question as it is not easy to draw a line between acceptable and an unacceptable rate of price increase.\n\nIn theory, zero inflation would be desirable. If prices are to be the yardstick for economic activity, zero inflation allows the yardstick to be reliable and unchanging, and in addition avoids the adverse effects of price fluctuations on income distribution.\n\nI said that this is true \"in theory\" for several reasons. First, there are limitations to the accuracy of price statistics in that it is difficult to exclude price increases arising from improvements in product quality or to reflect changes in the market share of products. As the statistics become biased due to such technical limitations, some argue that it is undesirable to aim at zero inflation based on a specific price indicator. In addition, if there is a downward rigidity in certain prices and wages due to business practices and contractual constraints, the cost of achieving zero inflation could become substantial.\n\nIn view of the significance of price stability as discussed earlier, a more practical criterion would be the sustainability of price stability in the medium to long term. This is because prices serve as a yardstick not only for deciding current production and consumption, but also for deciding the activities that lead to future economic developments, such as business fixed investment and savings. The perception that prices influence future\n\ndevelopments has led to an increasing tendency to view price stability as being the state in which firms and households need not consider prospective price fluctuations in their economic decision-making.\n\nEven when price indexes remain stable during a certain period, price stability in the medium to long term could be at risk if the economy is overheating and creating potential upward pressures on prices. Monetary policy must thus be managed not only to minimize current fluctuations in prices, but also to contain the potential risk of price fluctuations in the future. This is why price stability is said to be a medium to long-term objective of monetary policy.\n\nThe maintenance of price stability does not conflict with the achievement of stable economic growth and employment conditions. For example, measures to prevent overheating (or recession) of the economy can at the same time contain inflation (or avoid deflation), and provide medium to long-term price stability; and this price stability, in turn, is a prerequisite for achieving sustainable growth of the economy, as I mentioned earlier.\n\n## D. Features of Monetary Policy\n\nI would now like to examine the important elements in managing monetary policy.\n\nThere are two features of monetary policy that differentiate it from other economic policies. The first feature is that monetary policy uses market-oriented measures to transmit policy effects to market participants and therefore the efficacy of monetary policy depends on the market's reaction to the measures taken by the central bank. In this respect, monetary policy differs significantly in nature from the government's economic policy, which aims to achieve its objectives through administrative means such as laws and regulations.\n\nSpecifically, monetary policy affects the supply and demand of funds in the financial markets through the implementation of the Bank's daily operations, such as bill and bond transactions. The mechanism is initiated in changes made to the money market interest rates, or in technical terms, changes to the overnight rates in the interbank market, which can be referred to as the wholesale market for cash and reserves. Changes in these rates affect other short-term interest rates and longer-term rates through arbitrage in the markets, which in turn influence changes in the deposit and lending rates offered by banks. These changes in interest rates as a whole then influence the economic activities of the corporate and household sectors.\n\nWith the completion of the deregulation of interest rates, use of the market mechanism is currently the most effective way of transmitting policy effects throughout the financial markets and the economy. However, in order to effectively utilize this mechanism, public and market confidence in monetary policy is of decisive importance. Unless the policy intentions of the central bank are fully understood and considered to be credible, the effects of interest rate policies will not permeate adequately, and market interest rates may fluctuate independently of the intentions of the central bank, affected by unnecessary conjecture and rumors.\n\nThe second distinct feature of monetary policy is that considerable time is required before its effects materialize, in other words, there is a long time lag before policy effects permeate throughout the economy.\n\nThe mechanism through which changes in interest rates are transmitted to economic activity is complicated. Interest rate changes may have a relatively rapid influence on firms planning to make an investment in the near future. Theoretically, the effect of interest rate changes should be swiftly transmitted to fluctuations in asset prices.\n\nOn the other hand, it takes a considerable time for the effects of interest rate changes to appear in actual corporate profits and household income levels. One reason is that\n\nthere are various types of borrowing and investment with short and long maturities. As new interest rates are applied to these instruments only at the time of maturity, considerable time is required before the overall interest rate level changes and before the new level takes effect throughout the economy. In addition, changes in corporate profits and income levels will only bring about a gradual change in the confidence of firms and households in their investment and consumption, and after some delay in time, new decisions will be made on investment and consumption. Further time is then needed before these decisions materialize as actual spending.\n\nIt has been said that pre-emptive policy responses are necessary to ensure price stability. This is because, as mentioned earlier, price stability must be achieved in the medium to long term, and because there will always be a considerable time lag before policy effects permeate throughout the economy. As this time lag in permeation of policy effects has become more widely recognized, greater emphasis has come to be placed in the management of monetary policy on assessing the potential risks in the economy, to enable pre-emptive policy responses.\n\n## E. Considerations in Monetary Policy Management\n\nThe requirements for monetary policy are thus \"maintenance of market confidence\" and \"pre-emptive response\". It is, however, extremely difficult to achieve these two requirements simultaneously.\n\nLet me explain how the two requirements conflict. In order to make timely policy responses, it will be necessary for the central bank to act based on its projections of the economic and price situations one or two years ahead. However, considering the difficulty of accurately predicting economic developments, such action may not necessarily result in market confidence in the Bank's policy. Nevertheless, it would be impossible to act pre-emptively if the Bank waited until a consensus was reached on future economic developments and desirable policy actions.\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that the key to monetary policy management is in finding how these two requirements can be fulfilled simultaneously.\n\nCentral banks have tried to meet the two requirements through various techniques. For example, many central banks in the past adopted \"money supply targeting\", in which monetary policy is aimed at achieving an intermediate target of money supply growth. This is a method based on the causality that fluctuations in money supply influence real economic activity with some time lag. However, it has been pointed out that financial innovations have made it difficult to discern the relationship between money supply and economic activity, and that although the relationship between the two is stable in the long term, it may be unsteady in the short term. Accordingly, many of the central banks which set a money supply target today mainly use it as a general guideline for monetary policy or refer to it as one of the major indicators in making policy decisions, rather than attempting to adhere rigidly to it.\n\nSome central banks now adopt \"inflation targeting\", in which a certain target range is set for the inflation rate. This method aims to secure the confidence of the market by declaring beforehand the central bank's commitment to a specific target. For those central banks employing inflation targeting, another challenge besides setting the target range is devising how to take appropriate, individual policy actions under the price target. Countries with high inflation rates have succeeded in containing these rates by employing inflation targeting. However, the fact that the method has been effective in curbing a high inflation rate does not necessarily indicate that it will also be effective in sustaining already stable prices.\n\nRecently, some academics in the United States have suggested evaluating the potential risks of price and economic fluctuations based on such concepts as the output gap and\n\nthe expected inflation rate, and then utilizing these evaluations as guidelines in managing monetary policy.\n\nUnfortunately, it is difficult to establish rules or other convenient guidelines which are by themselves sufficient to ensure an optimal policy response. It is for this reason that the Bank of Japan has never adopted stringent targeting or specific rules to date, but instead has consistently emphasized the judgement of the overall economic conditions and has made efforts to improve underlying research and analytical skills.\n\nLearning from the bitter experiences of the emergence and the bursting of the \"bubble\" economy, the Bank attaches utmost importance to realizing price stability and thereby economic stability in the long run, and, to this end, identifying and assessing the potential risks within the economy. The Bank has also been making increased efforts to explain its actions and policy in detail in order to gain the better understanding of the public.\n\nOne of the aims of last year's series of monetary easing measures was to eliminate the possibility of a deflationary spiral, in other words, a potential risk of excessive price declines. The Bank also made efforts to provide a clearer explanation of the details of policies implemented and the thinking behind these policies. Announcements of the Bank's stance on money market operations and improvements in the monthly and annual reports of the Policy Board are results of these efforts.\n\nThe Bank intends to continue investigating ways of fulfilling simultaneously the two requirements of pre-emptive policy responses and of the maintenance of market confidence, by learning from theoretical and empirical studies and from the experiences of other central banks.\n\nI would like to emphasize that, in order to maintain market confidence in the central bank which is an essential task for achieving price stability in the medium to long term, the institutional independence of the central bank becomes very important. Accordingly, it will be necessary to enhance the transparency of policy decisions and to establish a framework to ensure the Bank's accountability.\n\n## V. Conclusion\n\nThe review of the central bank system in Japan is likely to develop into a revision of the Bank of Japan Law after the Central Bank Study Group submits its report.\n\nWhen seen from the vantage point of reconsidering the broad framework of economic policy, I believe that the revision of the Bank of Japan Law is significant not only to the Bank of Japan itself or to the financial sector, but also to the overall economy. Now that Japan's industries are making steady efforts to adapt to a new era, it is also required that the economic policy management of Japan be reformed to suit the times.\n\nThe Bank of Japan Law is to be reviewed as the first concrete step in the reform process of Japan's economic policy management. The law, stipulated in 1942, has been one of the rules and regulations constituting the basis of the old regime which has affected the country's economic policy management for the past 50 years. This is why much international attention is now focused on the reform of the central bank system in Japan.\n\nIn order for the central bank to achieve its missions, improvement of the institutional framework is necessary, but what is more important is that the Bank manages its policy and operations with due responsibility. We at the Bank are very conscious of this and will exert ourselves to the utmost to ensure that the Bank fulfills its responsibilities amid the ongoing globalization and shifts to market-oriented economies. I would like to conclude by expressing my hope for your continued support and understanding.",

         "Speech by the Governor of the People's Bank of China, Mr. Dai Xianglong, at the Hong Kong Association of Banks' Dinner on 13/11/96.",
         "Mr.  Dai  looks  at  the  possibilities  of  strengthening  financial  co-operation between  China  and  Hong  Kong  in  order  to  promote  economic  prosperity  and  stability Speech by the Governor of the People's Bank of China, Mr. Dai Xianglong, at the Hong Kong Association of Banks' Dinner on 13/11/96.\n\nI would like to thank the Hong Kong Association of Banks for inviting me to Hong Kong to meet with you and to attend this dinner function. Although this is my first visit to Hong Kong since taking up my post in the central bank, we follow closely the economic developments of Hong Kong. All of you have contributed to the prosperity of Hong Kong. I greatly appreciate the wisdom and the spirit of the people of Hong Kong. They are industrious and always striving for the better. Hong Kong's success is partly attributable to the characteristics of its people. We have good reasons to believe that through our joint efforts, Hong Kong will have an even better future.\n\nI  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  give  a  brief  description  of  the  current situation of the economic and financial reforms in the mainland as well as the basic principles and policies towards the financial relationship between China and Hong Kong after 1997. In addition, I would also say something on co-operation and joint development between the financial sectors of China and Hong Kong.\n\n## I. Mainland China's economy is experiencing a stable development\n\nFirst  of  all,  I  would  like  to  talk  about  the  financial  and  economic  conditions  of China  which  is  a  hot  topic  for  discussion  among  professionals  from  the  Hong  Kong  financial sector.  This  is  because  Hong  Kong's  future  is  closely  linked  with  the  economic  and  financial developments of China.\n\nChina's  economy  began  to  pick  up  in  1992  with  a  dynamic  national  economy. However, there was also hyper-inflation. During the latter half of 1993, the Chinese Government began to adopt an appropriately tight monetary policy. The adoption of this policy means firstly, price increases should be kept at a level lower than the rate of economic growth. Secondly, the growth of money supply should be slightly above the sum of the rate of economic growth and the target  rate  of  the  price  increase.  Thirdly,  indirect  monetary  instruments  should  be  used  more frequently for relating money supply so that the economy will not be too volatile. Our efforts in the past three years are beginning to pay off. We have successfully curbed inflation by making macro-economic adjustments.\n\nFirstly, the growth of the money supply has slowed down. It is expected that the total money supply at the end of this year will be 26% higher than the previous year. This growth rate is 3.7% lower than the average annual growth rate during the period under the 'Eighth FiveYear Plan'.\n\nSecondly,  price  increases  have  slackened  noticeably.  During  the  period  from January to October, retail prices have risen by 6.4% as compared to the same period last year. It is expected that the growth rate for the whole year will be around 6.5%.\n\nThirdly, the economy continues to grow at a relatively high rate. During the period from January to September, GDP rose by 9.6%. It is anticipated that the annual growth rate will exceed 9.5%.\n\nFourthly,  our  foreign  reserves  continue  to  grow.  As  at  the  end  of  October,  our foreign reserves reached US$ 98.8 billion. We are certain that our reserves will exceed US$ 100 billion by the end of the year. The trade surplus is estimated to be over US$ 100 billion this year. There is also US$ 40 billion of foreign direct investment. The supply of foreign exchange exceeds demand  and  the  exchange  rate  of  the  renminbi  remains  stable.  Moreover,  the  renminbi  has become  fully  convertible  in  the  current  account.  Our  experience  proves  that  we  are  right  in adopting  an  appropriately  tight  financial  and  economic  policy.  Our  ability  in  performing macro-economic operations has improved greatly and our achievements are recognised internationally.\n\nDespite the foregoing, several major problems remain to be solved. The percentage of financial revenues in GDP is still falling. The asset quality of banks still needs to be improved. The basic elements of the agricultural sector remain relatively weak and it is unlikely to have any improvement in the operational efficiency of state-owned enterprises in the short run.\n\nIn  view  of  the  current  economic  situation,  the  focus  of  economic  and  financial reforms in the coming year will be placed on promoting the reform of the economic system and changing  the  pattern  of  economic  growth.  We  will  continue  to  adopt  an  appropriately  tight financial and monetary policy. Further efforts will be made to adjust the structure of the economy so as to foster new areas of economic growth. In order to ensure steady growth of the national economy, efforts will also be made to develop domestic as well as overseas markets. Based on the above considerations, it is desirable that next year's target annual GNP growth rate should be set at 8-9% while the retail price increase be contained at a level below 6%. In order to achieve these targets, the People's Bank of China is prepared to:\n\n1.  Control  money  supply.  Our  preliminary  proposal  is  to  contain  the  increase  of next year's total money supply (M2) within the range of 23% to 25%.\n2. Adjust the credit structure. The total amount of loans to the agricultural sector will be increased. Economic integration and the setting up of conglomerates will be encouraged. Efforts will also be made to promote the development and sale of residential property.\n3. Conduct  monetary  operations. Employ  more  frequently monetary policy instruments  such  as  interest  rate  policy,  reserve  requirements  and  open  market  operations  to regulate the money supply.\n4.  Deepen  financial  reforms.  Reforms  of  state  banks  should  be  stepped  up.  New commercial  banks  will  be  set  up.  The  policy  of  transforming  rural  credit  co-operatives  into co-operative  financial  institutions  will  be  maintained.  Direct  financing  will  be  developed  in  a prudent way with better management. In addition, the financial sector will continue to open up.\n5.  Foster  risk  management.  Continue  the  rationalisation  of  financial  order  and prevent and eliminate financial risks.\n\nIt is envisaged that China's economy and society will continue to develop steadily in  the  coming  years  and  objectives  embodied  in  the  'Ninth  Five-Year  Plan'  can  be  achieved. China will enter the 21st century with a dynamic economy and society.\n\nII. Basic principles and policies governing the financial relationship between mainland China and Hong Kong after 1997\n\nAs China and Hong Kong have different currencies and financial systems, people from Hong Kong as well as the international community are very much concerned with how the principle  of  'one  country,  two  systems'  can  be  implemented  as  regards  financial  issues.  It  is because the implementation of this principle has direct bearings on the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong as well as the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre.\n\n'The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic  of  China'  lays  down  specific  provisions  relating  to  Hong  Kong's  status  as  an international  financial  centre,  its  monetary  and  financial  policies,  the  status  of  the  Hong  Kong dollar and the issuing arrangements, capital flows and the role of the Exchange Fund. Our national leaders have reiterated on different occasions that the People's Bank of China, which is the central bank of the People's Republic of China, should insist on implementing the 'Basic Law' and the principle of 'one country, two systems'. We should also protect the financial relationship between Hong Kong and the mainland  which  can  be  summarised  as  'one  country,  two  currencies,  two monetary  systems  and  two  monetary  authorities'  within  a  sovereign  state  and  deal  with  issues relating to this relationship in an appropriate manner.\n\nAt  the  IMF/World  Bank  Annual  Meeting  which  was  held  in  late  September  this year,  I  stated  in  my  speech  our  principles  governing  the  financial  relationship  between  the mainland and Hong Kong. Mr Chen Yuan, the Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China, also presented these principles in a systematic manner at the Bank of England seminar which was held  in  September  this  year.  Both  the  People's  Bank  of  China  and  the  Hong  Kong  Monetary Authority (HKMA) have been offered membership in the Bank for International Settlements. This is a clear demonstration of the above principles and shows that the mutually independent financial relationship between the mainland and Hong Kong are widely accepted by international financial organisations.\n\nNow  I  am  going  to  give  an  outline  of  the  main  issues  relating  to  the  financial relationship between the mainland and Hong Kong after 1997.\n\nHong  Kong  will  continue  to  maintain  its  own  system  of  currency  issuance  and management after 1997. The Hong Kong dollar and the renminbi will circulate as legal tender in Hong Kong and the mainland respectively. Hong Kong's existing note-issuing arrangements will remain unchanged. Moreover, China supports Hong Kong's commitment to the maintenance of the linked exchange rate system.\n\nIt  follows  from  the  two  mutually  independent  monetary  systems  of  the  mainland and  Hong  Kong  that  the  two  monetary  authorities,  i.e.  the  People's  Bank  of  China  and  the HKMA, will also be mutually independent. The HKMA will be accountable solely to the Hong Kong Government. The People's Bank of China will not take the place of the HKMA and will not set up any office in Hong Kong. The People's Bank of China will strengthen further its present sound co-operation with the HKMA. The HKMA has made great contributions to the stability of the local currency and the supervision of financial institutions. Such efforts by the HKMA help promote the prosperity and smooth transition of Hong Kong.\n\nThe Hong Kong Government will continue to supervise local financial institutions. The  supervision  will  continue  to  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  Hong  Kong's  laws  and international rules and practices. mainland financial institutions in Hong Kong shall not enjoy any privileges. They shall be regulated by the relevant supervisory authorities in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Exchange Fund of Hong Kong shall be managed and controlled by the Hong Kong Government. The financial revenues of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be  used  exclusively  for  its  own  purposes  and  the  Chinese  Government  shall  not  levy  taxes  in Hong Kong. Moreover, China will not draw on or resort to Hong Kong's Exchange Fund or other assets in any way and for any reason.\n\nAll financial transactions between the mainland and Hong Kong will be conducted in  accordance  with  the  rules  and  practices  of  international  financial  activities.  Claims  and liabilities between institutions from the mainland and those from Hong Kong will continue to be regarded as external claims and liabilities. When participating in the Hong Kong market, Chinese entities will have equal treatment as other international and local market participants.\n\nApart  from  the  above,  it  is  also  important  for  Hong  Kong  as  an  international financial centre to continue to develop its international monetary relations and participate in the activities of international and regional financial institutions. There are therefore provisions in the Joint  Declaration  and  the  Basic  Law  that  Hong  Kong  may,  on  its  own,  maintain  and  develop financial  relations  with  other  countries,  regions  and  relevant  international  organisations  after 1997. The 1997 World Bank/IMF Annual Meeting will be held in Hong Kong just a few months after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. This is a magnificent financial event and I am confident that it will be successful.\n\n## III  The  strengthening  of  financial  co-operation  and  the  promotion  of  economic  prosperity  and stability between the mainland and Hong Kong\n\nMainland China and Hong Kong have close financial links with each other. Since the  implementation  of  financial  reforms  and  the  open-door  policy,  such  links  have  been strengthened  further.  It  is  necessary  to  further  enhance  such  a  mutually  beneficial  relationship between the two places.\n\nFirst of all, the mainland and Hong Kong should work together for the prosperity, stability and smooth transition of Hong Kong. China's commitment to the implementation of the 'one country, two systems' principle is increasingly accepted and appreciated by the people  of Hong Kong and the international community. Worries and doubts about the future of Hong Kong which emerged in the early 1980's have largely subsided. We are pleased to note that the financial situation in Hong Kong is heading towards a smooth transition. We are confident that Hong Kong will enjoy financial stability before and after 1997. Even though there may be some fluctuations in Hong Kong's financial market, we believe that the HKMA is fully capable of handling these situations  satisfactorily.  If  necessary,  the  People's  Bank  of  China  will,  at  the  request  of  the HKMA and in accordance with the Basic Law and market practices, offer support to the HKMA. Financial stability in Hong Kong before and after 1997 is not only essential to the prosperity of Hong Kong and China but also to financial stability in the Asia-Pacific Region. We are confident that the international financial community, including the central banks in the Asia-Pacific Region, will be actively involved in the efforts to maintain Hong Kong's financial stability.\n\nSecondly,  the  two  places  should  work  closely  together  to  maintain  and  enhance Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre. Hong Kong has some unique competitive advantages in being an international financial centre in a number of aspects such as opportunities, geographic location and people. I have made it clear to the international financial community on many occasions that after China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong, the status of Hong Kong as an international  financial  centre  will  not  be  undermined  but,  rather,  it  will  be  further strengthened.  This  is  because  the  many  unique  advantages  which  Hong  Kong  enjoys  now  will\n\ncontinue to exist after 1997. There is also the Basic Law which guarantees that Hong Kong will remain  unchanged.  More  importantly,  with  the  sustained,  rapid  and  healthy  growth  of  the economy in China - the vast hinterland at the back of Hong Kong - numerous opportunities will be  created  for  Hong  Kong's  financial  sector.  All  these  are  favourable  conditions  for  the maintenance  and  strengthening  of  Hong  Kong's  status  as  an  international  financial  centre. Economic developments in the mainland have given rise to strong demand for funds and Hong Kong will continue to be our major funding centre. We will strengthen our coordination and cooperation  with  Hong  Kong  in  areas  such  as  the  development  of  markets  and  infrastructures  in response  to  the  needs  of  financial  developments  in  both  places.  I  have  met  with  many  central bankers and major international bankers and they all agreed that Hong Kong should be  able  to maintain its status as an international financial centre as regards the future relationship  between Hong Kong and Shanghai. I think as a national economic centre, Shanghai's financial status will become  increasingly  important.  However,  it  will  not  be  possible  for  Shanghai  to  become  an international financial centre in the longer term and it will not replace Hong Kong.\n\nThirdly, the mainland and Hong Kong should co-operate fully with each other so as to promote prosperity and stability. Since the implementation of economic reforms and the opendoor policy, financial co-operation between the two places has been strengthened which, in turn, helps to develop economic and trading ties. At present, China and Hong Kong are each other's major  investment  and  trading  partner.  As  at  the  end  of  1995,  Hong  Kong's  total  cumulative investment in China reached US$ 78.6 billion, accounting for 58% of total foreign investment in China. In 1995, 90% of the syndicated loans to China were arranged in Hong Kong and 90% of the Chinese companies listed on overseas stock markets have their primary listing in Hong Kong. The volume of import and export trade between the two places amounted to US$ 44.6 billion last year, accounting for 15.9% of China's total external trade. If Hong Kong's entrepôt trade which came from China is also taken into account, the figure reached US$ 124.1 billion, accounting for 34.1%  of  Hong  Kong's  total  external  trade  in  that  year.  The  number  of  mainland  financial institutions in Hong Kong is on the rise and vice versa. These institutions are going to provide a whole range of financial services which are conducive to the continuous and stable development of the economic relationship between the two places.\n\nChina will further open up its financial markets. This includes the opening up of more districts,  the  gradual  relaxation  of  renminbi  business  and  the  gradual  introduction  of  the investment banking mechanism. The Hong Kong financial sector will directly benefit from these moves since  they  will  offer  numerous  business  opportunities.  In  the  course  of  stepping  up  our pace of financial reforms, we have to keep on learning from advanced international management experience  and  to  provide  training  to  outstanding  personnel.  We  hope that the financial community in Hong Kong will provide us with assistance and support in these areas.\n\nBefore ending my speech, I would like to point out that the Hong Kong Association of Banks has contributed a lot in assisting the HKMA to ensure the financial stability of Hong Kong. I hope all of you will continue to give your support to the HKMA and play a more active role in promoting economic and financial developments in Hong Kong and its smooth transition. I would also like to announce that an association of mainland banks will be formed this year. I hope that  the  two  banking  associations  will  strengthen  their  exchanges  and  co-operation  and  work together for a more prosperous future.\n\nA delegation from the Hong Kong Association of Banks will visit Beijing in a few days. I would like to welcome the delegation on behalf of the People's Bank of China. I will meet with some of you again on that occasion. We can further exchange views on the strengthening of co-operation between the banking sectors on the mainland and in Hong Kong.",

         "Mr. Davies gives his personal view of EMU  (Central Bank Articles and Speeches, 16 Dec 96)",
         "Speech by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. Howard Davies, at the EFMA Conference on the Single Currency in Brussels on 16/12/96.",
         "Mr. Davies gives his personal view of EMU Speech by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. Howard Davies, at the EFMA Conference on the Single Currency in Brussels on 16/12/96.\n\nLike many British men of my generation, I spent a good part of my spare time as a boy involved with the Scouting movement, first as a Wolf Cub, then as a Boy Scout.\n\nI have to confess that I have forgotten many of the useful things I learned in the Boy Scouts.  I can no longer light a camp-fire using only two sticks.  I can no longer tie a clove hitch.  But I can remember the Boy Scout's motto - 'Be Prepared'.  And that motto strikes me as a  useful  injunction  to  bear  in  mind,  as  we  approach  the  D-Day  for  Economic  and  Monetary Union of 1 January 1999.  It applies, I think, just as much to those who may, for one reason or another, find themselves outside the first group of EMU countries, as it does to those who firmly intend to surf on the first wave.  The preparations, though, may be slightly different in each case.\n\nNow some of you may think, if you read the British press, or hear echoes of the British  political  debate  on  EMU  through  the  media  elsewhere  in  Europe,  that  in  present circumstances one of the other pieces of advice which Lord Baden-Powell handed down to Boy Scouts  who  followed  him  would  be  more  appropriate.    I  am  thinking  particularly  of  the injunction to smile and whistle through all difficulties.  Certainly I am sometimes tempted, when asked to explain the state of opinion in London, to take refuge in a cheery smile, and to begin to whistle  a mournful tune (not easy to do at the same time, you will find).\n\nFortunately,  it  is  not  my  responsibility  to  discuss  the  politics  of  EMU  in  the United Kingdom.  Another good reason for me not to do so is that I would like to keep my job. As a humble central banker, a mere technician, it is more appropriate for me to  focus  on  the economic dimension of EMU and to say something, also, about the financial market implications which concern us, particularly given the Bank of England's position at the heart of the City of London.\n\nIn both these areas - economic and financial - the Boy Scout motto is particularly apposite today.  Let me explain why.\n\nAt  the  Bank  of  England  we  have  always  held  the  view  that  Economic  and Monetary Union is a momentous enterprise, with huge consequences for European economies. The act of irrevocably fixing exchange rates, between economies which have in many cases been managed separately for centuries, is not a step to be undertaken lightly.  It is an exciting venture, almost too exciting for some, perhaps.\n\nThose who have operated for decades with a regime of low inflation, interest rates set by a strong independent central bank, and a strong and appreciating currency, may rightly think they have little to fear from the disciplines implied by EMU.  Others will find EMU more bracing, particularly those whose inflation record has been poor, whose currency has undergone successive devaluations, and whose fiscal position is less than robust.  For those countries, the EMU mission is potentially dangerous.\n\nJoining EMU would for them be to embark on a stiff mountain ascent, in weather which might be colder and less forgiving than one is used to.  In those circumstances, the Boy Scout ensures that he is well prepared.  He equips himself with waterproofs in the event of rain, with thick pullovers for the cold, with stout boots and, probably, a Swiss army knife in case it should prove necessary, at some point on the journey, to extract a stone from a horse's hoof.  He would also, I think, wish to ensure that he was fit, and had undertaken some strenuous rambles\n\nin the foothills before making an assault on the mountain range.\n\nAt  this  point  you  may  be  tired  of  hearing  about  Boy  Scouts,  and  be  ready  to accuse  me  of  the  typical  British  trick  of  hiding  behind  down-home  metaphors,  and  reducing topics of high seriousness to wry jokes.  So let me be entirely clear about what I mean.\n\nWe  fully  appreciate  the  great  potential  advantages  of  EMU  for  Europe's economies. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, described them in the House of Commons on Wednesday of last week.  As he said then \"if EMU can be made to work it would eradicate  exchange  rate  movements  which  can  disrupt  trade  and  have  disrupted  trade  in  our recent history.  EMU would also reduce transaction costs, making it easier for smaller businesses to enter into and compete in the European market.  The members of a strong euro zone could also expect to enjoy lower interest rates . . . countries with a history of devaluation or bursts of inflation pay a lasting premium in terms of higher interest rates, as we in Britain know only too well!\"  And in his response to the debate Gordon Brown, the Shadow Chancellor, said that he was in principle in favour of a single currency for the United Kingdom.\n\nSo the attractions of EMU are well understood in Britain.  They were in the minds of the architects of the Maastricht Treaty five years ago.  But those architects also knew that the advantages  would  only  be  accessible  to  those  countries  whose  economies  were  equipped  to accept  the  disciplines  which  go  alongside.    If  that  were  not  true,  then  the  EU  would  have discovered the economic equivalent of alchemy.\n\nWe  are  convinced  that  if  a  single  currency  is  to  be  a  success,  then  all  the participants must be satisfied that they can survive within the EMU disciplines in the long term, as well as the short.  This applies to the 1997 convergence criteria themselves, of course.  It also applies  to  performance  against  those  criteria  in  later  years.    And,  in  our  view,  perhaps  more controversially,  it  applies  to  other  aspects  of  the  real  economies  of  applicant  countries, particularly to the structures of their labour markets.\n\nIn the case of the convergence criteria, our attitude is straightforward.  They must be rigorously respected.  And that applies to the substance, as well as the form.  So it would be unwise for a country to seek to qualify in 1998 by massaging down its 1997 public sector deficit through artificial, unrepeatable devices, even if those devices are not technically disallowed.\n\nIt  would  be  unwise,  because  the  deficit  limit  is  not  a  one-off  requirement. Continued discipline on individual member states' budget positions is a crucial element of EMU in the future.  Friday's agreement at Dublin provides for such discipline, albeit with an element of political judgement over the way that discipline will be exercised in certain circumstances.\n\nBut  the  general  conclusion  is  clear.    Member  states  will  need  to  live  with continued  fiscal  discipline.    In  our  view,  unless  a  country  can  show  that  its  fiscal  position  is structurally sound - in other words that in mid-cycle, with the economy growing at trend on its potential growth path, the budget of the government would tend to be close to balance - then it may find the fiscal discipline of EMU difficult to sustain.  That is both a long-term point, and one relevant to the transition period.  It would be potentially destabilising of the whole project if countries  found  themselves  obliged  to  take  extremely  difficult  political  decisions  in  the  early years because their fiscal positions had not been properly corrected beforehand.\n\nOf  course  it  goes  without  saying  that  if  a  country's  outstanding  debt  burden  is well  above  the  Maastricht  guideline  it  will  be  much  more  difficult  to  achieve  a  sustainable\n\ndeficit position, since it will be necessary to run sizeable primary surpluses at high points in the cycle.    It  is  worth  recalling  that  when  the  Treaty  set  a  figure  of  60 per  cent  of  GDP  the  EU average was 55 per cent.  This year it will be over 73 per cent, and only Luxembourg, France and the UK will be below 60 per cent.\n\nAny country with a very large outstanding debt to GDP ratio will find the going particularly tough.  As far as the UK is concerned, our debt to GDP ratio is relatively low at 56 per cent, but while we have made considerable progress towards fiscal consolidation in recent years, our deficit remains above the Maastricht guideline, even after almost five years of growth. A UK government of any political colour, as it comes to make a decision on our readiness for EMU  membership  next  year,  will  be  bound  to  take  that  into  consideration.    The  latest government forecast, after the recent Budget, shows us achieving a figure of a touch below 3 per cent in calendar 1997.\n\nI could make similar points about the exchange rate criterion where, once again, we believe  it  is  important  to  focus  on  the  substance  rather  than  on  the  form.    Has  a  country shown that its anti-inflation discipline, over a lengthy period, has allowed its currency to hold its own without generating significant current account imbalances?  For some applicant countries, the answer is evidently yes; for others, no.  Once again, that is an issue which we will have to consider carefully as we assess the position of the United Kingdom next year.\n\nI  imagine  that  these  points  would  be  very  widely  accepted  across  the  EU, certainly by my central banking colleagues.  But our view of the optimal state of preparedness for EMU is rather broader than this.  And, here - as I said earlier - we may be less obviously in the mainstream of European opinion.  Because we have concerns about the sustainability of an Economic  and  Monetary  Union  in  which  there  is  too  little  flexibility  in  product  and  labour markets,  particularly  the  latter.    Is  the  monetary  union  being  designed  one  which  retains sufficient  flexibility  to  cope  with  the  kind  of  differential  shocks  which  may  affect  different countries within it?  This point is, I think, not the same as asking whether the EU is an optimal currency area.  I suspect the answer to that question would be no.  But one might well give the same answer in relation to the United States, or even to the United Kingdom itself.  The question is  whether  there  is  sufficient  flexibility  within  the  proposed  currency  union  to  cope  with asymmetric shocks.\n\nWe know that, in the United States, there is considerable fiscal flexibility, some through  automatic  stabilisers,  like  federally-funded  welfare  benefits,  and  some  through  direct transfer  payments  from  prosperous  to  less  prosperous  states.    We  also  know  that  there  is considerable labour mobility in the United States, and that wages vary widely  from  region  to region.\n\nIn Europe, the central EU budget is very small, less than 1.5 per cent of European GDP, and there is no strong current of opinion in favour of expanding it significantly.  It is also the case that labour mobility is low, for linguistic and cultural reasons, which cannot easily be overcome by government fiat.\n\nNow I would certainly not argue that an EMU could not be attempted without a huge central  EU  budget,  or  without  teaching  everyone  commercial  German.    But  we  need  to make sure that labour markets are as prepared as they can be for the future, a future in which there  will  be  no  possibility  of  the  use  of  the  exchange  rate  to  cope  with  changes  in competitiveness,  from  country  to  country,  whether  driven  by  supply-side  shocks  or  by differential rates of productivity growth.  Our concern is that, unless EMU is accompanied by\n\nmeasures  to  free  up  Europe's  labour  markets,  existing  high  rates  of  unemployment  in disfavoured regions will be ossified, with unpredictable and possibly unpleasant social consequences in the long term.\n\nLooking  at  Europe's  regional  economies,  it  is  striking  that  relativities  between them  have  remained  so  stubbornly  large  for  so  long,  even  within  individual  member  states. Indeed only in the UK have there been some recent signs that relative unemployment rates, from prosperous to less prosperous regions, have begun to converge.  That appears to be related in changes in relative wages which have come about as a result of the dismantling of centralised pay bargaining, and of other labour market restrictions, in the 1980s.  Elsewhere in Europe those changes have not been made; without them we would have to enter a reserve on the preparedness of some European economies for the rigours of a single currency.  That is another point which, I am sure, any British government will wish to take into account in making its final decision.  And we would feel more comfortable about the likely success of EMU as a whole - and I emphasise that the success of EMU is strongly in the British national interest, whether we are in or out were we to see faster progress towards greater labour market flexibility elsewhere in Europe.\n\nIt may be argued that EMU itself will act as a stimulus to reforms needed in fiscal policy,  and  in  labour  markets;  indeed  that  the  prospect  of  EMU  is  already  doing  so.    We  cautious,  pragmatic,  non-visionary  people  that  we  are  -  would  like  to  see  the  needed  reforms implemented first.\n\nThese  preparations,  both  in  the  financial  and  the  real  economies,  are  the preparations  which  prospective  'ins'  need  to  make,  in  particular.    But  there  are  of  course preparations  in  financial  markets  which  apply  to  everyone.    We  are  in  no  doubt  that  the introduction  of  the  euro  in  1999,  if  the  current  timetable  is  maintained,  will  have  profound consequences  for  financial  markets,  initially  for  wholesale  markets,  and  later  for  the  retail financial  sector  too.    It  is  incumbent  on  all  central  banks  to  seek  to  ensure  that  the  financial markets in which they sit are as well prepared as they can be for this momentous change.  We must also ensure that the central banks themselves are well prepared.\n\nAt the Bank of England we now have a steering group, which I chair, focused on preparing the Bank itself.  We have made a clear decision that the Bank will be ready for UK membership of EMU in January 1999, if a future government decides that that is the right course for the country.  But our more important work in the short term is focused on preparing the City of London and on preparing the financial infrastructure which the City will need to maintain its position as the most innovative and dynamic financial market in Europe.\n\nI  should  emphasise  that  we  see  the  City  as  a  financial  market  for  the  whole  of Europe, not just for the United Kingdom.  That explains why we are always ready to welcome overseas financial institutions to London, why we rigorously avoid discrimination on grounds of nationality in our financial market dealings, and why we have greatly welcomed the decisions by German, French and Swiss banks in particular to concentrate many of their wholesale  market activities in London in recent years.  Europe needs a broad and deep market like London to rival those in Tokyo and New York.\n\nI would not wish, today, to talk at length about the preparations being made in the City  for  EMU.    Partly  because  this  afternoon,  in  London,  we  shall  be  releasing  our  latest quarterly report on Practical Issues Arising from the Introduction of the Euro, which sets out in some detail the progress that has been made over the last three months, and how we propose to take things forward.  In short, we are confident that London will be as well prepared for EMU as\n\nany market, when the time comes.\n\nAs  we  say  in  that  paper,  we  are  fully  involved  in  preparing  the  wholesale financial  sector  of  the  economy  for  the  euro  and,  of  course,  in  the  extensive  work  being undertaken  at  the  European  Monetary  Institute.    For  the  most  part  that  work  is  proceeding successfully  and  we  are  happy  with  the  decisions  made.    Some  are,  inevitably,  compromises. But  that  is  what  building  Europe  is  all  about,  and  we  are  always  ready  to  seek  compromise solutions.  We understand that to build one European wholesale financial market will require a staple diet of solid Bundesbank fare, seasoned with a soupçon of Banque de France, a ración of Banco de España, and so on, as well as a couple of pints of Bank of England pragmatism.\n\nThere is one important area, I think, in which it has not so far been possible to reach an agreed solution, and one on which I might just conclude with one or two observations. That is the question of TARGET, the inter-linking of real time gross settlement systems across Europe.  There are two issues of interest, here.  First, pricing policy.  We have argued that the pricing of the national element of cross-border payments should relate to national costs, rather than  being  set  uniformly.    So  far  we  have  not  prevailed  on  that  point  and,  as  long  as  the competition  authorities  approve,  it  is  likely  that  there  will  be  a  common  price  within  the TARGET system for cross-border transactions.  Unfortunately, some of our colleagues do not believe this is an area in which competition should intrude.\n\nThe second important question relates to the terms on which 'out' central banks might link to TARGET in the future.  We can see no reason why out central banks should not be able  to  link  to  TARGET  on  the  same  terms  as  those  which  apply  to  the  ins.    We  accept,  of course, the need in both in and out countries for rigorous policing to prevent unintended spillover of intra-day credit into the overnight market.  That policing can be achieved through penal interest  rates.    But  we  can  see  no  monetary  policy  issue  in  relation  to  intra-day  credit.    The extension of sterling intra-day liquidity in our present domestic RTGS system is of no interest to, and never considered in the context of, monetary policy decisions.  The same holds for all other countries.\n\nIndeed we could go further and say that denying even-handed access to TARGET through out central banks will negate one of the main purposes of the whole exercise, to reduce the  risk  inherent  in  systems  in  which  banks  are  exposed  to  each  other  for  a  period  of  hours. Banks would find other ways round the restriction which would be more risky.  So central banks across Europe will have scored an own goal.\n\nWe  shall  need  to  look  carefully  at  this  issue  as  we  move  towards  1999.    If restrictions were to be applied to out central banks which made TARGET unattractive to banks in  London,  thereby  encouraging  them  to  use  less  secure  cross-border  mechanisms  for  euro payments, then we shall need to think about the other options we  could  adopt.    One  possible option might be to develop our own euro RTGS arrangements to allow quick, efficient and safe euro payments within the UK which would not rely on access to intra-day credit from the euro area.\n\nWe would prefer a pan-European solution which, we strongly believe, would be in the interests of the EU as a whole in the long run.  But one thing is clear.  Safe, efficient and competitive payment and settlement systems must be available in our own marketplace, and they will be.\n\nLondon has huge advantages as a strong and competitive financial centre in or out\n\nof  EMU.  We are confident that those advantages will remain.  The fact that  more  and  more banks are centring their foreign exchange, corporate finance and investment business in London suggests  that  they  share  our  confidence  in  the  future  of  London.    In  these  matters  it  always seems  to  me  to  be  best  to  take  one's  cue  from  'revealed  preferences'  -  where  financial institutions choose to base themselves, taking account of all the uncertainties.  Those revealed preferences remain strongly in London's favour.\n\nThe preparations for EMU are now hotting up.  All over Europe, Boy Scouts are packing  their  rucksacks  with  the  kit  they  will  need  for  this  determined  assault  on  what,  in deference to its German roots, we should perhaps call the Magic Mountain, with apologies to Thomas Mann.    The  Magic  Mountain  is  perhaps  a  more  tactful  title  to  choose  than  The Confessions  of  Felix  Krull,  Confidence  Man,  or  Death  in  Venice,  as  some  others  in  London might  suggest.    I  hope  that  this  morning  I  have  given  you  some  insights  into  what  we  think should be in the central banker's  rucksack,  and  how  the  United  Kingdom  will  assess  its  own preparedness next year, when the time comes.\n\nBIS Review   1/1997",

         "BANK OF FRANCE, PRESS RELEASE, 17/12/96.",
         "## M. Trichet presents the monetary policy guidelines of the Bank of France for 1997 BANK OF FRANCE, PRESS RELEASE, 17/12/96.\n\n1. The ultimate goal of monetary policy is to ensure price stability, as required by legislation.  The  objective  of  the  Monetary  Policy  Council  is  that  the  increase  in  prices,  as measured by the consumer price index, should not exceed 2% in 1997, as in the medium term.\n2.  To  meet  this  ultimate  goal,  the  Banque  de  France  uses  two  intermediate objectives, one of which is external and the other internal:\n3. -The objective of a stable external value of the currency: as it has been for ten years, the stability of the franc will be maintained against the group of the most credible currencies in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.\n4. -An intermediate internal growth target for the money supply as assessed by  the  development  of  the  narrow  and  broad  monetary  aggregates:  in 1997, the money supply should be able to show a  medium-term  growth trend of 5%. This figure is consistent with price inflation of no more than 2% and non-inflationary real GDP growth of about 2.5%, which could be exceeded, in view of the potential for growth to catch up in the medium term. The  Monetary  Policy  Council  has decided to simultaneously monitor the main narrow and broad money aggregates in order to obtain a concise estimate of all monetary developments.\n3. Total domestic debt is an important indicator. It helps the Banque de France make sure that the economy is supplied with enough financing to grow, and it enables us to track developments in financing for businesses, households and general government simultaneously.\n\nThe Monetary Policy Council will keep a close eye on other indicators, including all  leading indicators of  changes  in  prices,  such  as  capacity  utilization  rates,  production  costs, developments in incomes and commodity prices. The Monetary Policy Council will also monitor long-term interest rates and the current account balance.\n\n## * * *\n\nBefore announcing the Council's monetary policy decisions for 1997, I would like to discuss the results achieved in 1996.\n\n## 1. The 1996 results are in line with the targets we set.\n\nThe ultimate monetary policy goal, which is price stability, was met. Businesses delayed passing on part of the August 1995 two-point increase in the standard rate of VAT until the beginning of 1996. The twelve-month rise in consumer prices was equal to and then above 2% during the first seven months of 1996, but subsequently fell back  to  1.ó%  in  August  and September, once the VAT effect had disappeared. The twelve-month increase stood at 1.5% to 1.ó% in November and the latest forecasts predict a price rise of close to 1.5% for the end of 1996. The twelve-month price increase thus resumed its pre-August 1995 trend and will be less than 2% at the end of 1996, in line with the objective set by the Monetary Policy Council.\n\nThe  objective  of  a  stable  external  value  of  the  French  franc  vis-à-vis  the  most credible currencies in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism was met.\n\nSince the beginning of 1996, the franc has continued to move gradually closer to its  central  rates  against  the  other  currencies  in  the  European  Exchange  Rate  Mechanism.  This firmness of the franc has gone hand in hand with the continuing overall competitiveness of the French economy. The real effective exchange rate of the French franc has improved and exports, as in previous years, helped to boost activity. The seasonally-adjusted current account surplus for the first nine months of 1996 stood at almost FRF 84 billion. This was much greater than the FRF 64 billion surplus posted for the same period of 1995. On the basis of current forecasts, France will record the third largest current account surplus in the world for 1996.\n\nGrowth  in  the  M3  reference  aggregate,  which  is  the  reference  for  our  internal intermediate objective, showed a reversal in its trend. The expansion of M3 at the end of  the third quarter of 1995 was close to its medium-term growth target path of 5%, but subsequently slowed sharply. The twelve-month increase of 4% in December 1995 gave way to a contraction of  0.4% in  October 1996, the last month for which figures are  available.  This  reversal  in  the growth of M3 was to a very great extent the result of a large-scale reallocation of investment flows stemming from the fall in short-term interest rates since autumn 1995, which has been of unprecedented magnitude and rapidity.\n\nThe  M3-M2  aggregate,  which  includes  assets  paying  money  market  rates  of interest, posted a twelve-month fall of 10.1 % at the end of October 1996. In response to the fall in  short-term  interest  rates  and  also  a  heavier  tax  burden  on  money  market  mutual  funds, economic agents reallocated their portfolios towards assets covered by the investment aggregates,  and  particularly  the  Pl  aggregate  covering  contractual  savings  products,  including housing saving plans. Year-on-year growth in P1 accelerated from 12.3% in December l995 to 18.5% in October 1996.\n\nThe  rate  of  interest  paid  on  housing  savings  plans  has  remained  unchanged  at 5.25% since February 1994, whereas comparable market rates have fallen sharply. This gave a strong  boost  to  the  reallocation  of  investment  flows.  Year-on-year  growth  in  housing  savings plans accelerated significantly, rising from 14.1% at the end of 1995 to almost 26% in October 1996.\n\nIn  addition,  twelve-month  growth  in  the  P2  aggregate  covering  investment  in bonds and life insurance products remained buoyant. It stood at 12.3% in June 1996, with new investment accounting for 9%.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  formation  of  liquidity  was  dynamic.  The  narrow  money aggregates  M1  and  M2,  which  cover  transaction  balances  and  liquid  savings,  showed  annual growth trends in October 1996 of around 5.8% and 7.5%, respectively. In particular, the growth of  M2-M1,  covering  passbook  savings  deposits,  accelerated  from  7.6%  in  December  1995  to 9.6% in October 1996.\n\nIn such a context, it is important to monitor closely the investments which, within the P investment aggregates, constitute fairly close substitutes for monetary assets in the strictest sense. M3 + P1 posted significant annual growth of around 4%.\n\nOn the financing side, total domestic debt showed a yearly growth trend of around 3.3%.  Total  domestic  debt  incorporates  the  debt  financing  obtained  by  resident  non-financial agents in the corporate, personal and public sectors, be it in the form of borrowing from credit institutions or debt issues on domestic or international markets, and is thus a valuable yardstick\n\nfor analyzing the financing provided to the economy. Even though government debt continues to be the most dynamic component of total domestic debt, its twelve-month growth slowed sharply from  13.4%  in  December  1995  to  ó.9%  in  September  1996.  Outstanding  lending  by  credit institutions to the private sector is practically stable, particularly owing to the corporate sector's sizeable  cash  surplus.  According  to  the  National  Institute  for  Statistics  and  Economic  Studies (INSEE), the self-financing rate of companies and near-companies stood at around 114% in the second quarter of 1996.\n\nI shall now make a few comments concerning interest rates, which fell across the board in 1996.\n\nThis  decline  in  interest  rates,  which  began  in  October  1995,  corresponds  to  a considerable increase in confidence in the French franc and in the creditworthiness of France in connection with the policies set forth by the President of the Republic and the Government for the reduction of government deficits, the stability of the franc and Monetary Union in 1999.  In 1996, the Banque de France's repurchase tender rate was cut from 4.45% to 3.2% today. It is one of the lowest rates in the G7 countries in both nominal and real terms. The five-to-ten-day repo rate fell from 5.85% to 4.75%.\n\nShort-term  market  rates  eased  substantially,  with  three-month  rates  shedding almost 400 basis points since October 1995 and currently standing at around 3.4%.\n\nThe  easing  in  short-term  rates  went  hand  in  hand  with  a  significant  decline  in long-term  rates,  which  are  the  reference  for  a  large  share  of  lending  to  the  private  sector. Ten-year rates have fallen by more than 100 basis points since October 1995.\n\nThanks to the credibility of every component of its economic policy, France today enjoys  the  lowest  medium-  and  long-term  market  rates  in  the  European  Union,  and  the  third lowest rates in the world, bettered only by Japan and Switzerland.\n\nThis brings me to the monetary policy decisions for 1997.\n\n1. The  ultimate  goal  of  monetary  policy  is  to  ensure  price  stability,  as required by legislation. The objective of the Monetary Policy Council is that the increase in prices, as measured by the consumer price index, should not exceed 2% in 1997. as in the medium term.\n\n2. To meet this ultimate goal, the Banque de France uses two intermediate objectives , one of which is external and the other internal:\n2. -The objective of a stable external value of the currency: as it has been for ten years, the stability of the franc will be maintained against the group of the most credible currencies in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.\n3. -An intermediate internal growth target for the money supply assessed by the development of the narrow and broad monetary aggregates: in 1997, the money supply should be able to show a  medium-term  growth trend of 5%. This figure is consistent with price inflation of no more than 2% and non-inflationary real GDP growth of about 2.5%, which could be exceeded, in view of the potential for growth to catch up in the medium term. The  Monetary  Policy  Council  has decided to simultaneously\n\nmonitor the main narrow and broad money aggregates in order to obtain a concise estimate of all monetary developments.\n\n3. Total domestic debt is an important indicator. It helps the Banque de France make sure that the economy is supplied with enough financing to grow, and it enables us to track developments in financing for businesses, households and general government simultaneously.\n\nThe Monetary Policy Council will keep a close eye on other indicators, including all  leading indicators of  changes  in  prices,  such  as  capacity  utilization  rates,  production  costs, developments in incomes and commodity prices. The Monetary Policy Council will also monitor long-term interest rates and the current account balance .\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThese decisions call for two remarks.\n\nFirst, on a  technical  level,  the  Monetary  Policy  Council  has  decided  to  monitor several narrow and broad money aggregates simultaneously in order to obtain a concise estimate of  all  monetary  developments.  As  we  have  seen,  certain  data,  and  particularly,  but  not exclusively, M3 data, have been severely disrupted recently by several factors, such as the very substantial fall in short-term rates and the ensuing large-scale reallocation of investment flows towards non-monetary assets, higher taxes on money market mutual funds, and the continuing very high level of interest paid on housing saving plans.\n\nWe  will  therefore  keep  a  very  close  eye  on  the  M1,  M2,  M3,  and  M3+P1 aggregates  as  expressions  of  the  underlying  growth  of  the  money  supply.  Particular  attention will  be  paid  to  the  growth  of  the  M3+P1  aggregate  covering  monetary  assets  and  contractual savings.\n\nA very large proportion of the outflows from M3 in the past year was  directed towards  investments  covered  by  P1,  and  particularly  housing  savings  plans  with  a  residual maturity of one year or less. In fact, this type of investment at present constitutes a very close substitute for monetary assets.\n\nSecond,  the  Monetary  Policy  Council  has  set  monetary  policy  against  the background of potential growth for the French economy of around 2.5% per year. We consider the average growth of our economy in the medium-term, and it could be exceeded given that we have a potential to catch up in the medium term. We reckoned with a maximum price increase of 2% and potential real growth of between 2.5% and 3% in the medium term to arrive at a figure of 5% for the medium-term growth trend of the money supply.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nIt is very important to bear in mind the essence of the policy implemented by the Monetary Policy Council.\n\nParliament confers on the Banque de France an objective, namely the objective of price  stability.  Maintaining  the  value  of  the  currency  preserves  the  purchasing  power  of  the currency, and therefore that of French citizens.\n\nIn addition, Parliament has sought to create the conditions for growth and for job creation, via the stability of the currency. This is also the goal of the Monetary Policy Council. To achieve this goal, we use two means.\n\nFirst,  by  preserving  the  value  of  the  currency,  we  enhance  its  credibility  in France,  in  Europe  and  in  the  world  and  allow  our  economy  to  benefit  from  financing  at favourable market interest rates. It is  very  important  for  future  French  growth,  for  investment and  for  job  creation  that  we  have  the  lowest  medium-  and  long-term  market  rates  in  the European Union today and the third lowest interest rates in the world.\n\nSecond, price stability curbs cost increases in our productive sector. In doing so, the  competitiveness  of  our  economy-other  things  being  equal-is  preserved  and  enhanced. This  is  good  for  future  French  growth  and  for  job  creation.  It  is  important  to  note  that  we currently have a dynamic export sector and, according to the latest forecasts for 1996, the third highest current account surplus in the world.\n\nOne other indicator of competitiveness is encouraging, namely the flow of foreign direct investment into France. It stood at FRF 120 billion in 1995. The latest figures for the first nine  months  of  1996  show  inward  foreign  direct  investment  totalling  FRF  74  billion.  In  all, since the beginning of 1995, a total of FRF 194 billion, the equivalent of USD 39 billion, has been invested directly in France, making us the third-ranking industrialized economy in terms of inward foreign direct investment, behind the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nThus, when the Monetary Policy Council makes interest-rate decisions, it bears in mind first the objective of preserving the purchasing power of the currency, for and on behalf of all  French  people,  and  second,  its  corollary,  namely  the  creation  of  monetary,  financial  and competitive conditions that will allow our economy to achieve its full potential for sound and sustained growth, for job creation and therefore for combating unemployment.\n\nCentral  Banks  cannot  'command'  growth.  Growth  is  the  fruit  of  the  labour  of men and women, of the efficiency of employees, workers and engineers, of the imagination and skill of business leaders, and also, more broadly, of the influence of European and international business conditions. It  is  stimulated,  in  the  medium  and  long  term,  by  structural  reforms  that liberate initiative, strengthen the dynamism of the economy, combat unemployment effectively and encourage the creation of the greatest possible number of jobs for a given level of wealth and growth.\n\nHowever,  it  is  up  to  Central  Banks  to  create  the  best  possible  monetary  and financial conditions, through the credibility and stability of the currency.\n\nThese  conditions  now  exist  in  our  country  and  the  Monetary  Policy  Council  is convinced that the time has come for firms and households to invest. In many sectors and firms, the financing exists. The self-financing rate of the entire French productive sector is above 100% overall.  Interest  rates  as  a  whole  are  at  historic  lows.  The  French  economy  has  substantial\n\npotential for growth in the medium term. In the last three years, potential growth has averaged a little more than 2% a year for the years 1994, 1995 and 1996. We can do better. We believe that our economy's potential non-inflationary growth is around 2.5% in the medium term, and this can be exceeded given the capacity for growth to catch up. The requirements for investment are financing  terms,  self-financing,  competitiveness,  and  medium-term  growth.  We  believe  these requirements exist today.\n\nIf I had to sum up briefly the message of the Monetary Policy Council, I would say: 'The investment plans exist. The time has come today to implement them. Let us invest. It is the surest way for us to contribute to non-inflationary growth that creates jobs and thus to help in the fight against unemployment.'\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nFrench monetary policy is in line with the European strategy of the President of the Republic and the Government, and therefore with the creation of an economic and monetary union on 1 January 1996.\n\nThe  advance  towards  the  single  currency  was  decisively  confirmed  at  the European Summit in Dublin, where an agreement was reached on the legal status of the euro, on the new European Monetary System and on the stability and growth pact intended to guarantee fiscal discipline in the Monetary Union.\n\nThe  Banque  de  France's  monetary  policy  contributes  directly  to  our  country's success in meeting three of the five criteria for entry into Monetary Union: the criterion of price stability, which is the ultimate goal of our monetary policy; that of the stability of the franc visà-vis  the  most  solid  European  currencies,  which  is  an  intermediate  objective  to  which  the Banque  de  France  is  steadfastly  committed,  and  that  of  the  level  of  long-term  interest  rates, which is a result and an important indicator of our monetary strategy.\n\nl) Today, the Monetary Policy Council is happy to note that we fully meet these three entry criteria. The Council will continue to make sure that we abide by them throughout 1997 so that the Heads of State and Government can draw up the list of countries eligible for the euro in the best possible conditions, in accordance with the terms of the Dublin decision of the Heads of State and Government, 'as soon as possible in 1998'.\n\nThe  euro  will  be  created  on  1  January  1999.  Our  market  interest  rates  on maturities of more than two years already incorporate the credibility and soundness of the euro, the future single currency of European citizens. The agreement on the stability and growth pact drawn up in Dublin is a decisive element in inspiring confidence in the euro in French citizens and investors from around the world that is at least equal to the confidence in the French franc. This  will  give  us  low  market  interest  rates  in  the  euro  area,  which  is  good  for  growth,  job creation and the fight against unemployment.",

         "Remarks by the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, Ms. Alice M. Rivlin, at the The Brookings Institution National Issues Forum in Washington on 19/12/96.",
         "Ms. Rivlin discusses the prudential regulation of banks and how to improve it Remarks  by  the  Vice  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Governors  of  the  US  Federal  Reserve System,  Ms.  Alice  M.  Rivlin,  at  the  The  Brookings  Institution  National  Issues  Forum  in Washington on 19/12/96.\n\nI discovered when I joined the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System about  six  months  ago  that  most  of  my  friends  --  including  my  sophisticated  public  policy oriented  friends  --  had  only  a  hazy  notion  what  their  central  bank  did.  Many  of  them  said, enthusiastically,  'Congratulations!'  Then  they  asked  with  a  bit  of  embarrassment,  'Is  it  a full-time job?' or 'What will you find to do between meetings?' The meetings they were aware of, of course, were those of the Federal Open Market Committee. They knew that the FOMC meets every six weeks or so to 'set interest rates.' That sounds like real power, so the FOMC gets a lot of press attention even when, as happened again this week, we meet and decide to do absolutely nothing at all.\n\nThe  group  gathered  here  today,  however,  realizes  that  monetary  policy,  while important, is not actually very time-consuming. If you cared enough to come to this conference, you also have a strong conviction that the health and vigor of the American economy depends not only on good macro-economic policy, although that certainly helps, but also on the safety, soundness and efficiency of the banking system. We need a banking system that works well and one  in  which  citizens  and  businesses,  foreign  and  domestic,  have  high  and  well  placed confidence.\n\nSo I want to talk today, as seems appropriate on the fifth anniversary of FDICIA, about  the  subject  that  occupies  much  of  our  attention  at  the  Federal  Reserve:  the  prudential regulation of banks and how to improve it. Indeed, I want to focus today, not so much on what Congress  needs  to  do  to  ensure  the  safety  and  soundness  of  the  bank  system  in  this  rapidly changing world -- there are others on the program to take on that task -- but more narrowly on how bank regulators should go about their jobs of supervising bank risk-taking.\n\nThe evolving search for policies that would guarantee a safe, sound and efficient banking  system  has  featured  learning  from  experience.  In  the  1930s,  Americans  learned, expensively, about the hazards of not having a safety net in a crisis that almost wiped out the banking  system.  In  the  1980s,  they  learned  a  lot  about  the  hazards  of  having  a  safety  net, especially about the moral hazard associated with deposit insurance.\n\nDeposit  insurance,  which  had  seemed  so  benign  and  so  successful  in  building confidence and preventing runs on banks, suddenly revealed its downside for all to see. Some insured  institutions,  mostly  thrifts,  but  also  savings  banks,  and  not  a  few  commercial  banks, were taking on risks with a 'heads I win, tails you lose' attitude -- sometimes collecting on high stakes bets but often leaving deposit insurance funds to pick up the pieces. At the same time, some  regulators,  especially  the  old  FSLIC,  which  was  notably  strapped  for  funds,  were compounding  the  problem  --  and  greatly  increasing  the  ultimate  cost  of  its  resolution  --  by engaging in regulatory 'forbearance' when faced with technically insolvent institutions.\n\nThe  lessons  were  costly,  but  Americans  do  learn  from  their  mistakes.  The advocates of banking reform, many of them participants in this conference, saw the problems posed by moral hazard in the context of ineffectual supervision and set out to design a better system.\n\nEssentially, the reform agenda had two main components:\n\n* First,  expanded  powers  for  depository  institutions  that  would  permit  them  to diversify in ways that might reduce risks and improve operating efficiency;\n* Second, improving the effectiveness of regulation and supervision by instructing  regulators,  in  effect,  to  act  more  like  the  market  itself  when conducting prudential regulation.\n\nFDICIA was a first  step  toward  meeting  the  second  challenge  --  how  to  make regulators  act  more  like  the  market.  It  called  for  a  reduction  in  the  potential  for  regulatory 'forbearance'  by  laying  down  the  conditions  under  which  conservatorship  and  receivership should  be  initiated.  It  called  for  supervisory  sanctions  based  on  measurable  performance  (in particular,  the  Prompt  Corrective  Action  provisions  that  based  supervisory  action  on  a  bank's risk-based capital ratio). The Act required the FDIC and RTC to resolve failed institutions on a least-cost  basis.  In  other  words,  the  Act  required  the  depository  receivers  to  act  as  if  the insurance  funds  were  private  insurers,  rather  than  continue  the  past  policy  of  protecting uninsured  depositors  and  other  bank  creditors.  Finally,  FDICIA  placed  limitations  on  the doctrine of 'Too Big To Fail,' by requiring agency consensus and administration concurrence in order to prop up any large, failing bank. In a few places, however, FDICIA went too far. The provisions of the Act that dealt with micro management by regulators were immediately seen to be  'over  the  top,'  and  were  later  repealed.  The  Act  provided  a  framework  for  regulators  to invoke market-like discipline. It left room for them to move their own regulatory techniques in this direction -- a subject to which I will return in a minute.\n\nThe  other  objective  of  reform  --  diversification  of  bank  activities  through  an expansion of bank powers -- has not yet resulted in legislation and is still very much an on-going debate.  In  part,  this  failure  to  take  legislative  action  reflected  the  long-running  ability  of  the nonbank competition to use its political muscle to forestall increased powers for banks. But the inaction  on  expanded  powers  also  reflected  a  Congressional  concern  that  additional  powers might be used to take on additional risk, which, on the heels of the banking collapse of the late 1980s, represented poor timing, to say the least. There was also some Congressional disposition to punish 'greedy bankers,' who were seen as the reason for the collapse and the diversion of taxpayer  funds  to  pay  for  thrift  insolvencies.  Whatever  the  reasons,  not  only  did  the  102nd Congress  fail  to  enact  expanded  bank  powers,  but  so  did  the  next  two  Congresses.  We  are hopeful that the 105th Congress will succeed where its predecessors have failed. Meanwhile, the regulatory agencies have acted to expand bank powers within the limits of existing law.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has proposed both liberalization of Section 20 activities and expedited  procedures  for  processing  applications  under  Regulation  Y.  The  OCC  has  acted  to liberalize  banks'  insurance  agency  powers  and,  most  recently,  to  liberalize  procedures  for operating subsidiaries of national banks. Of course, I would have to turn in my Federal Reserve badge and give up my parking pass if I did not mention that we at the Fed believe that some activities are best carried out in a subsidiary of the holding company rather than a subsidiary of the bank. We believe that the more distance between the bank and its new, nonbank operations, the more likely that we can separate one from the other and avoid the spreading of the subsidy associated with the safety net.\n\nWhile  the  regulators  can  move  in  the  right  direction,  it  is  still  imperative  that Congress  act.  Artificial  barriers  between  and  among  various  forms  of  financial  activity  are harmful  to  the  best  interests  of  the  consumers  of  financial  services,  to  the  providers  of  those\n\nservices,  and  to  the  general  stability  and  well-being  of  our  financial  system,  most  broadly defined. Congress should consider this issue and take the next steps.\n\nLet me turn now to what I consider to be one of the most critical issues facing regulators, especially in a future in which financial markets likely will dictate significant further increases in the scope and complexity of banking activities. I am referring to the issue of how to conduct  optimal  supervision  of  banks.  Fortunately,  there  appears  actually  to  be  an  evolving consensus at least on the general principle. Regulators, including the Federal Reserve, strongly support the basic approach embodied in FDICIA; namely that regulators should place limits on depository institutions  in  such  a  way  as  to  replicate,  as  closely  as  possible,  the  discipline  that would be imposed by a marketplace consisting of informed participants and devoid of the moral hazard associated with the safety net.\n\nUnfortunately, as always, the devil is in the details. The difficult question is how should a regulator use 'market-based' or 'performance-based' measures in determining which, if any, supervisory sanctions or limits to place on a bank. FDICIA's  approach  was straightforward. Supervisory sanctions under Prompt Corrective Action were to be based on the bank's risk performance as measured by its levels of regulatory capital, in particular its leverage ratio  and  total  risk-based  capital  ratio  under  the  Basle  capital  standards.  These  standards  now seem well-intended  but  rather  outdated.  Certainly,  the  Basle  capital  standards  did  the  job  for which they were designed, namely stopping the secular decline in bank capital levels that, by the late 1980s, threatened general safety and soundness. But the scope and complexity of banking activities has proceeded apace during the last two decades or so, and standard capital measures, at least for our very largest and most complex organizations, are no longer adequate measures on which to base supervisory action for several reasons:\n\n* The regulatory capital standards apportion capital only for credit risk and, most recently,  for  market  risk  of  trading  activities.  Interest  rate  risk  is  dealt  with subjectively, and other forms of risk, including operating risk, are not treated within the standards.\n* Also, the capital standards are, despite the appellation 'risk-based,' very much a 'one-size-fits-all' rule. For example, all non-mortgage loans to corporations and  households  receive  the  same  arbitrary  8  percent  capital  requirement.  A secured  loan  to  a  triple-A  rated  company  receives  the  same  treatment  as  an unsecured loan to a junk-rated company. In other words, the capital standards don't measure credit risk although they represent a crude proxy for such risk within broad categories of banking assets.\n* Finally,  the  capital  standards  give  insufficient  consideration  to  hedging  or mitigating  risk  through  the  use  of  credit  derivatives  or  effective  portfolio diversification.\n\nThese  shortcomings  of  the  regulatory  capital  standards  were  beginning  to  be understood  even  as  they  were  being  implemented,  but  no  consistent,  consensus  technology existed at that time for invoking a more sophisticated standard than the Basle norms. To be sure, more  sophisticated  standards  were  being  used  by  bank  supervisors,  during  the  examination process,  to  determine  the  adequacy  of  capital  at  any  individual  institution.  These  supervisory determinations  of  capital  adequacy  on  a  bank-by-bank  basis,  reflected  in  the  CAMEL  ratings given  to  banks  and  the  BOPEC  ratings  given  to  bank  holding  companies,  are  much  more inclusive  than  the  Basle  standards.  Research  shows  that  CAMEL  ratings  are  much  better predictors of bank insolvency than 'risk-based' capital ratios. But, a bank-by-bank supervision, of course, is not the same thing as the writing of regulations that apply to all banks.\n\nIt  is  now  evident  that  the  simple  regulatory  capital  standards  that  apply  to  all banks  can  be  quite  misleading.  Nominally  high  regulatory  capital  ratios  --  even  risk-based capital ratios that are 50 or 100 percent higher than the minimums -- are no longer indicators of bank soundness.\n\nMeanwhile, however, some of our largest and most sophisticated banks have been getting  ahead  of  the  regulators  and  doing  the  two  things  one  must  do  in  order  to  properly manage  risk  and  determine  capital  adequacy.  First,  they  are  statistically  quantifying  risk  by estimating the shape of loss probability distributions associated with their risk positions. These quantitative measures of risk are calculated by asset type, by product line, and, in some cases, even  down  to  the  individual  customer  level.  Second,  the  more  sophisticated  banks  are calculating  economic  capital,  or  'risk  capital,'  to  be  allocated  to  each  asset,  each  line  of business,  and  even  to  each  customer,  in  order  to  determine  risk-adjusted  profitability  of  each type of bank activity. In making these risk capital allocations, banks are defining and meeting internal  corporate  standards  for  safety  and  soundness.  For  example,  a  banker  might  desire  to achieve at least a single-A rating on his own corporate debt. He sees that, over history, single-A debt has a default probability of less than one-tenth of one percent over a one year time horizon. So the banker sets an internal corporate goal to allocate enough capital so that the probability of losses  exceeding  capital  is  less  than  0.1  percent.  In  the  language  of  statistics,  this  means  that allocated capital must 'cover' 99.9 percent of the estimated loss probability distribution.\n\nOnce  the  banker  estimates  risk  and  allocates  capital  to  that  risk,  the  internal capital allocations  can  be  used  in  a  variety  of  ways    --    for  example,  in  so-called  RAROC  or risk-adjusted return on capital models that measure the relative profitability of bank activities. If a particular bank product generates a return to allocated capital that is too low, the bank can seek to cut expenses, reprice the product, or focus its efforts on other, more profitable ventures. These profitability  analyses,  moreover,  are  conducted  on  an  'apples-to-apples'  basis,  since  the profitability of each business line is adjusted to reflect the riskiness of the business line.\n\nWhat these bankers have actually done themselves, in calculating  these  internal capital  requirements,  is  something  regulators  have  never  done  --  defined  a  bank  soundness target. What regulator, for example, has said that he wants capital to be high enough to reduce to 0.1 percent the probability of insolvency? Regulators have said only that capital ratios should be no lower than some number (8 percent in the case of the Basle standards). But as we should all be aware, a high capital ratio, if it is accompanied by a highly risky portfolio composition, can result in a bank with a high probability of insolvency. The question should not be how high is the bank's capital ratio, but how low is its failure probability.\n\nIn  sharp  contrast  to  our  8  percent  one-size-fits-all  capital  standard,  the  internal risk-capital calculations of banks result in a very wide range of capital allocations, even within a particular category of credit instrument. For example, for an unsecured commercial credit line, typical  internal  capital  allocations  might  range  from  less  than  1  percent  for  a  triple-A  or double-A  rated  obligor,  to  well  over  20  percent  for  an  obligor  in  one  of  the  lowest  rating categories. The range of internal capital allocations widens even more when we look at capital calculations  for  complex  risk  positions  such  as  various  forms  of  credit  derivatives.  This  great diversity in economic capital allocations, as compared to regulatory capital allocations, creates at least two types of problem.\n\n* When the regulatory  capital  requirement  is  higher  than  the  economic  capital allocation, the bank must either engage in costly regulatory arbitrage to evade\n\n- the regulatory requirement or change its portfolio, possibly leading to suboptimal resource allocation.\n* When  the regulatory requirement is lower than the economic capital requirement,  the  bank  may  choose  to  hold  capital  above  the  regulatory requirement  but  below  the  economic  requirement;  in  this  case,  the  bank's nominally high capital ratio may mask the true nature of its risk position.\n\nMeasuring  bank  soundness  and  overall  bank  performance  is  becoming  more critical as the risk activities of banks become more complex. This condition is especially evident in  the  various  nontraditional  activities  of  banks.  In  fact,  'nontraditional'  is  no  longer  a  very good  adjective  to  describe  much  of  what  goes  on  at  our  larger  institutions.  Take  asset securitization, for example. No longer do our largest banks simply take in deposit funds and lend out the money to borrowers. Currently, well over $200 billion in assets that, in times past, have resided on the books of banks, now are owned by remote securitization conduits sponsored by banks.  Sponsorship  of  securitization,  which  is  now  almost  solely  a  large  bank  phenomenon, holds  the  potential  for  completely  transforming  the  traditional  paradigm  of  'banking.'  Now, loans are made directly by the conduits, or are made by the banks and then immediately sold to the conduits. To finance the origination or purchase of the loans, a conduit issues several classes of  asset-backed  securities  collateralized  by  the  loans.  Most  of  the  conduit's  debt  is  issued  to investors who require that the senior securities be highly rated, generally double-A and triple-A. In order to achieve these ratings, the conduit obtains credit enhancements insulating the senior security  holders  from  defaults  on  the  underlying  loans.  Generally,  it  is  the  bank  sponsor  that provides these credit enhancements, which can be in the form of standby letters of credit to the conduit, or via the purchase of the most junior/subordinated securities issued by the conduit. In return for providing the credit protection, as well as the loan origination and servicing functions, the bank lays claim to all residual spreads between the yields on the loans and the interest and non-interest cost of the conduit's securities, net of any loan losses. In other words, securitization results in banks taking on almost identically the same risks as if the loans were kept on the books of the bank the old-fashioned way.\n\nBut while the credit risk of a securitized loan pool may be the same as the credit risk of holding that loan pool on the books, our capital standards do not always recognize this fact. For example, by supplying a standby letter of credit covering so-called 'first-dollar' losses for the conduit, a bank might be able to reduce its regulatory capital requirement, for some of its activities,  by  90  percent  or  more  compared  with  what  would  be  required  if  the  bank  held  the loans directly on its own books. The question, of course, is whether the bank's internal capital allocation systems recognize the similarity in risk between, on the one hand, owning the whole loans and, on the other hand, providing a credit enhancement to a securitization conduit.\n\nIf  the  risk  measurement  and  management  systems  of  the  bank  are  faulty,  then holding a nominally high capital ratio -- say, 10 percent -- is little consolation. In fact, nominally high capital ratios can be deceiving to market participants. If, for example, the bank's balance sheet  is  less  than  transparent,  potential  investors  or  creditors,  seeing  the  nominally  high 10 percent  capital,  but  not  recognizing  that  the  economic  risk  capital  allocation  should,  in percentage terms, be much higher, could direct an inappropriately high level of scarce resources toward the bank.\n\nCredit derivatives are another example of the evolution. The bottom line is that, as  we  move  into  the  21st  century,  traditional  notions  of  'capital  adequacy'  will  become  less useful  in  determining  the  safety  and  soundness  of  our  largest,  most  sophisticated,  banking organizations.  This  growing  discrepancy  is  important  because  'performance-based'  solutions\n\nlikely  will  continue  to  be  touted  as  the  basis  for  expanded  bank  powers  or  reductions  in burdensome  regulation.  For  example,  the  Federal  Reserve's  recent  proposed  liberalization  of procedures for Regulation Y activities applies to banking companies that are 'well-capitalized' and  'well-managed.'  Similarly,  the  OCC's  recent  proposed  liberalization  of  rules  for  bank operating  subsidiaries  applies  to  'well-capitalized'  institutions.  Also,  industry  participants continue to call for expanded powers and/or reduced regulatory burden based on 'market tests' of good management and adequate capital.\n\nIt  will  not  be  easy  reaching  consensus  on  how  to  measure  bank  soundness  and overall  bank  performance.  It  cannot  simply  be  done  by  observing  market  indicators.  For example, we cannot easily use the public ratings of holding company debt. The ratings, after all, are  achieved  given  the  existence  of  the  safety  net.  The  ratings  are  biased,  therefore,  from  the perspective of achieving our stated goal -- to impose prudential limits on banks as if there were no net. In addition, I am sure that there would be disagreement between market participants and regulators over what should be acceptable debt ratings. The solution may be for the regulators to use the analytical tools developed  by the market participants themselves for risk  and performance assessment. Regulators already have begun to move in this direction. For example, beginning in January 1998, qualifying large multinational banks will be able to use their internal Value-at-Risk  models  to  help  set  capital  requirements  for  the  market  risk  inherent  in  their trading  activities.  The  Federal  Reserve  is  also  conducting  a  pilot  test  of  the  pre-commitment approach  to  capital  for  market  risk.  In  this  approach,  banks  can  choose  their  own  capital allocations, but would be sanctioned heavily if cumulative trading losses during a quarter were to  exceed  their  chosen  capital  allocations.  These  new  and  innovative  methods  for  treating  the age-old problem of capital adequacy are likely to be followed by an unending, evolutionary flow of  improvements  in  the  prudential  supervisory  process.  As  the  industry  makes  technological advances in risk measurement, these advances will become imbedded in the supervisory process. For example, the banking agencies have announced programs to place an increased emphasis on banks' internal risk  measurement and management processes  within  the  assessment  of  overall management quality -- that is, how well a bank employs modern technology to manage risk will be reflected in the 'M' portion of the bank's CAMEL rating. In a similar vein, now that VaR models are being used to assess regulatory capital for  market  risk,  it  is  easy  to  envision  that, down the road, banks' internal credit risk models and associated internal capital allocations will also be used to help set regulatory capital requirements.\n\nRegulation  and  supervision,  like  industry  practices  themselves,  are  continually evolving  processes.  As  supervisors,  our  goal  must  be  to  stay  abreast  of  best  practices, incorporate these practices into our own procedures where appropriate, and do so in a way that allows banks to remain sufficiently flexible and competitive. In conducting prudential regulation we  should  always  remember  that  the  optimal  number  of  bank  failures  is  not  zero.  Indeed, 'market-based'  performance  means  that  some  institutions,  either  through  poor  management choices, or just because of plain old bad luck, will fail. As regulators, we must carefully balance these market-like results with concerns over systemic risk. And, as regulators of banks, we must always  remember  that  we  do  not  operate  in  a  vacuum  --  the  activities  of  nonbank  financial institutions are also important to the general well-being of our financial system and the macro economy.\n\nRegulators, of course, can only work with the framework laid down by Congress. Let me conclude with the hope that this Congress will build on the experience of the last few years, including the experience with FDICIA, and take the next steps toward creating a structural and regulatory framework appropriate to the 21st century.",

         "Bank of Japan's December review of monetary and economic trends in Japan  (Central Bank Articles and Speeches, 20 Dec 96)",
         "BANK OF JAPAN, MONTHLY ECONOMIC REVIEW, 20/12/96.",
         "## Bank  of  Japan's  December  review  of  monetary  and  economic  trends  in  Japan BANK OF JAPAN, MONTHLY ECONOMIC REVIEW, 20/12/96.\n\nA moderate economic recovery continues in Japan, as private demand shows increasing firmness. With respect to final demand, public sector investment has peaked, but housing investment has remained at a high level because of low interest rates. The decline in net exports has paused. Business fixed investment is increasing steadily and a moderate increase also continues in personal consumption. Meanwhile,  inventories  on  the  whole  are  at  appropriate  levels.  In  these  circumstances,  industrial production  growth  is  somewhat  accelerating  and  corporate  sentiment  is  improving  gradually.  Labor market conditions have improved on the whole, although the unemployment rate has remained at a high level. Meanwhile, the decline in prices is slowing gradually and monetary aggregates continue to grow at 3.0 - 4.0 per cent.\n\nWith regard to personal consumption, growth in sales of electrical appliances has been high, particularly in personal computers and cellular phones, and passenger car sales (excluding compact cars) have recently increased significantly. Outlays for travel have remained firm and sales at department stores and supermarkets are increasing at a moderate pace.\n\nAmong leading indicators of business fixed investment, machinery orders are increasing steadily  albeit  with  some  quarterly  fluctuations.  After  the  decline  in  the  third  quarter  1996,  they  are expected  to  increase  significantly  in  the  fourth  quarter.  Construction  floor  area  has  also  picked  up moderately. According to the Bank of Japan's Tankan -- Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan of  November  1996,  business  fixed  investment  plans  of  principal  manufacturing  firms  for  fiscal 1996 continued to increase at the same pace as those for fiscal 1995, while those of non-manufacturing firms turned to increase for the first time in five years. As a result, business fixed investment of principal firms overall is expected to expand at a faster pace than in fiscal 1995. Business fixed investment plans of  small  firms  (all  industries)  were  revised  upwards  substantially  from  the  August  Tankan,  marginally exceeding the level of the previous year for the first time in five years. This shows that the recovery in business fixed investment is spreading across a wider spectrum of industries and corporate sizes.\n\nWith respect to housing investment, housing starts have continued to grow reflecting low interest rates and reasonable housing prices. It recorded a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 1.82 million starts in October 1996, the highest level since November 1973, partly reflecting the increase in orders in September 1996 before the expected rise in the consumption tax.\n\nRegarding public-sector  investment,  the  volume  of  public  works  contracted  has,  since spring  1996,  stayed  virtually  unchanged  from  the  level  of  the  previous  year  as  orders  included  in  the economic  policy  package  of  September  1995  subsided.  Public  works  activities  such  as  shipments  of related  goods  increased  until  summer  1996,  reflecting  time lags between  the order and actual implementation of public works. Recently, however, they have also peaked out.\n\nReal  exports  have  shown  a  moderate  increase  as  the  effects  of  the  yen's  depreciation since  summer  1995  have  gradually  become  apparent  after  a  time  lag.  Meanwhile,  real  imports  have continued to rise, in part supported by structural elements, e.g., the increased supply capacity of Asian economies. However, the tempo of increase has somewhat slowed, which also reflects the depreciation of the yen. Thus, both the real trade surplus and the nominal current account surplus declined rapidly until the first half of 1996 but have been rising since summer 1996.\n\nIndustrial  production  increased  steadily  in  the  third  quarter  1996  by  an  annual  rate  of about 6 per cent and also rose significantly in October. These increases reflect the progress in inventory adjustments and the continued increase in shipments of capital goods, which is closely related to business fixed investment. They also reflect higher growth in domestic sales and exports of passenger cars which have a large influence on production activities. Industrial production is expected to increase by an annual rate of about 10 per cent in the fourth quarter 1996 on the whole.\n\nBIS Review   142/1996\n\nThe Tankan of November 1996 shows that the corporate profits of principal firms in both the manufacturing (excluding petroleum refining) and non-manufacturing sectors are forecast to continue increasing  in  fiscal  1996.  Profit  levels  have  risen  particularly  for  manufacturing  firms;  the  current profit-to-sales  ratio  is  expected  to  reach  over  4  per  cent  for  the  first  time  in  five  years.  In  these circumstances, business confidence of principal manufacturing firms improved moderately and is forecast to continue its upward trend. In the assembly industry in particular, the percentage differential between firms  responding  \"favorable\"  and  \"unfavorable\"  has  turned  positive  for  the  first  time  since  February 1992.  For  non-manufacturing  firms,  business  confidence  has  strengthened  but  it  is  forecast  to  weaken somewhat  in  the  near  future.  On  average,  business  confidence  of  non-manufacturing  firms  is  on  an upward  trend.  Small  firms  in  both  the  manufacturing  and  non-manufacturing  sectors  are  expected  to show continuing growth in profits in fiscal 1996. However, while business confidence of manufacturing firms  continues  to  improve  moderately,  that  of  non-manufacturing  firms  remains  virtually  unchanged partly as a result of uncertainties about the outlook for public-sector investment.\n\nLabor  market  conditions  have improved  somewhat  on  the whole. Although  the unemployment rate remains at a high level and employment growth is weak, overtime working  hours have increased, and the ratio of job offers to job applications has continued its gradual rise.\n\nWith  respect  to  price  developments,  domestic  wholesale  prices  (adjusted  for  seasonal electricity  rates)  seem  to  have  stopped  declining  although  downward  pressures  from  competition  with imports  remain  strong.  This  development  was  supported  by  the  yen's  depreciation  to  date,  the  rise  in crude  oil  prices  and  the  improvement  in  domestic  supply  and  demand  conditions,  particularly  in construction-related  goods.  Corporate  service  prices  have  declined,  particularly  in  rents  and  leasing charges,  but  the  year-to-year  decrease  has  become  smaller.  Consumer  prices  (nationwide,  excluding perishables) have stayed slightly above the previous year's level as commodity prices have continued to fall gradually and service prices have risen somewhat.\n\nGrowth in monetary aggregates, measured in terms of the year-to-year growth rate of M2 +CDs average outstanding, has remained at 3.0 - 4.0 per cent, albeit with some fluctuations.\n\nRegarding money market rates, the overnight call rate (uncollateralized) on the whole has stayed below the official discount rate of 0.5 per cent. The 3-month CD rate has moved at around 0.5 per cent.  Meanwhile,  with  regard  to  the  market's  interest  rate  expectations,  3-month  Euro-yen  futures declined at a somewhat brisk pace between the second half of July and autumn 1996, and have moved at around 0.7  -  0.9  per  cent  since  September  1996.  As  the  market's  expectations  of  higher  interest  rates receded,  the  long-term  government  bond  yield  has  declined  since  mid-July  1996,  and  recorded  a historical low of 2.34 per cent in early December. Recently, it has been moving at around 2.4 per cent.\n\nWith respect to bank lending rates, the short-term prime lending rate has remained at a record low level of 1.625 per cent since September 1995. The long-term prime lending rate was lowered by a total of 0.8 percentage points in September, October, and December to reach a record low of 2.5 per cent, reflecting developments in long-term market rates. In these circumstances, short-term and long-term average contracted interest rates on new loans and discounts have moved at record low levels.\n\nOn the stock exchange, the Nikkei 225 Stock Average had remained virtually unchanged since  summer  1996  at  around  ¥20,000  -  21,000,  varying  across  firms.  Recently,  however,  it  has weakened somewhat.\n\nIn the foreign  exchange  market, the yen's appreciation reversed its course  and depreciated against the U.S. dollar between summer 1995 and autumn 1996. Since early 1996, the yen has  continued  to  depreciate  and  has  recently  moved  at  around  ¥114.  Meanwhile,  the  yen  depreciated temporarily against the deutsche mark in October and November 1996, and has recently moved at around ¥72 - 73.",

         "Translation of an article by the President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Prof. Hans Tietmeyer, published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on 28/12/96.",
         "Prof. Tietmeyer discusses the Bundesbank's commitment to stability Translation  of  an  article  by  President  of  the  Deutsche  Bundesbank,  Prof.  Hans  Tietmeyer, published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on 28/12/96.\n\nIn post-war Germany, there has been a broad consensus about the importance of a stable  currency  across all political  groupings.  The  bitter  consequences  of  two  previous hyperinflations as well as the positive experience gained with the D-Mark and its strength played a major role in this.\n\nIn the recent past, however, the public debate has sometimes caused doubts to be raised concerning how far this consensus still goes. Admittedly, there have often been similar disputes in post-war history. One has only to remember the controversy surrounding the D-Mark appreciations  in  the  sixties,  when  the  relationship  between  internal  monetary  stability  and external exchange rate stability first became an issue. Or the arguments in the seventies about the spurious  alternative  of  more  inflation  or  more  unemployment.  Ultimately,  however,  all  these controversies did not seriously jeopardise the consensus on stability; if anything, they tended to strengthen it, in fact.\n\n## New discussion on stability\n\nIn  the  run-up  to  the  introduction  of  European  monetary  union  and  against  the backdrop of very sharp exchange rate changes in the first half of the nineties, the debate about the importance of monetary stability -- at least in some of its forms -- seems to have gained a new quality. For example, it is not only the trade-off between inflation and unemployment -- that had  been  thought  to  have  been  overcome  --  which  has  been  revived  recently  in  a  number  of comments made by industry,  the  trade  unions  and  politicians.  In  view  of  the  degree  of  price stability achieved, adherence to a policy of non-inflationary growth is occasionally even brought into discredit as a deflationary policy. Perhaps even more frequently one hears the proposition that foreign exchange rate stability must purportedly assume priority over internal price stability -- exchange rate stability evidently meaning the nominal and not the real (price level-adjusted) stability of exchange rates. A sustained low external value of the D-Mark has not infrequently even been regarded as necessary (or at least beneficial) for the German economy, regardless of its implications for internal monetary stability.\n\nIn  the  recent  past,  this  debate  has  also  increasingly  become  part  of  the  wider discussion  about  monetary  integration  in  Europe.  It  is  thus  acquiring  a  new  dimension,  even going as far as postulating European monetary  union  at  all  costs;  in  other  words,  a  monetary union which would tend to result in a soft  rather  than  a  strong  euro.  At  any  rate,  there  are  a number of participants in the current discussion (in Germany, too) who -- without saying it so explicitly, of course -- evidently regard the changeover to the euro as a welcome opportunity of lessening the D-Mark's former external strength. The open or covert advocates of a weakening of the currency on competitive grounds obviously fail to recognise the interrelationship between internal and external stability. They overlook the fact that, in the past, Germany was regularly among those countries with the lowest interest rate level world-wide -- precisely because of the stability  of  its  currency.  That  was  and  continues  to  provide  a  strong  competitive  edge  which cannot  be  rated  too  highly,  quite  apart  from  the  generally  cost-curbing  effects  of  monetary stability.\n\nThe  fact  that  such  depreciation  strategies  are  at  variance  with  the  aim  of  the Maastricht Treaty and even more so with its interpretation by the Bundestag, the Bundesrat and\n\nthe  Federal  Constitutional  Court  seems  either  not  to  be  taken  into  consideration  or  to  be deliberately  accepted.  The  Bundesbank's adherence to internal monetary stability has led to  it being accused of an undue stability policy bias, or even of being obsessed with stability.\n\n## Bundesbank in favour of a stability union\n\nTo  avoid  any  misunderstanding:  the  Bundesbank  is  committed  to  the  road  to European monetary union laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. In the relevant bodies at national and European level it is collaborating intensively in solving the complex and by no means easy technical  tasks  involved  --  these  range  from  harmonising  the  hitherto  very  different  monetary policy  instruments  in  Europe,  putting  in  place  the  organisational  and  legal  framework  for  the European Central Bank and the euro, to a fundamentally new and modernised payment system. All  this  work  should  not  be  underestimated.  The  preparations  have  to  be  advanced  to  a  stage which  enables  the  European  Central  Bank  Council  to  take  decisions  immediately  after  it  has been established. The  European  Central  Bank  System  has  to  be fully operational  and functionally viable right from the very first day of monetary union. And the set of instruments then in force must not put individual banking groups at a disadvantage or jeopardise the benefits of the decentralised banking structure which obtains, particularly in Germany, and the dominant long-term orientation of the markets.\n\nAs  important  as  this  intensive  collaboration  in  the  technical  preparation  of monetary union may be, what is of even greater importance is the Bundesbank's public advocacy of  monetary  union  actually  becoming  a  permanent  stability  union,  as  is  provided  for  in  the Maastricht  Treaty  and  is  quite  obviously  desired  by  the  majority  of  the  population.  Although there  are  occasionally  slight  differences  of  emphasis  on  individual  points,  there  is  complete unanimity  within  the  Central  Bank  Council  concerning  the  goal  itself.  Monetary  union  must become a permanent stability union with a strong currency, not least in order to prevent political conflict which might otherwise pose a risk at a later date. The Bundesbank is at one in favouring the  creation  of  the  economic  and  political  preconditions  which  will  ensure  that  the  monetary stability gained through the D-Mark  is likewise permanently maintained following the changeover to the euro. It has the authority to do this not only by virtue of the  consensus  on non-inflationary growth prevailing in Germany, it is also under a statutory obligation to do so. In accordance with article 3 of the Bundesbank Act it has the legal mandate of 'safeguarding the currency'.  Moreover,  in  accordance  with  article  12  it  'is  required  to  support  the  general economic policy of the Federal Cabinet', but only without prejudice to the performance of its primary  duty  to  'safeguard  the  currency'.  The  Act  explicitly  states  that  the  Bundesbank  is independent of instructions from the Federal Cabinet in exercising its powers.\n\n## Priority of internal stability\n\nHowever,  the  legal  wording  'to  safeguard  the  currency'  does  not  seem  to  be totally  unambiguous with regard to the  question  of  internal  monetary  stability  having  priority over exchange rate stability. At the time this law was drafted in 1957, when the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates was still in force worldwide, internal and external exchange rate stability  was  virtually  free  of  conflict.  It  was  not  until  tensions  emerged  between  the  major industrial countries, as a result of domestic policy decisions and priorities drifting apart, that the subject of protecting internal stability policy against external constraints (as it was later called by Karl Schiller) became a matter of key importance. As the sixties progressed, the Bundesbank in Germany, with the  vigorous  support  of  the  Federal  Economics  Ministers  Ludwig  Erhard  and\n\nKarl Schiller, committed itself more and more unequivocally to the priority of internal monetary stability.  And  that  has  remained  the  case  to  the  present  day,  with  far-reaching  agreement between the Federal Government and the Bundesbank. The Maastricht Treaty even adopted the priority  of  internal  stability  expressis  verbis,  in  fact.  Maintaining  price  stability  has  been enshrined in article 105 as the primary objective of the European System of Central Banks. The Bundesbank's primary orientation towards internal price stability is hence fully consistent with the regulations which will apply one day to the European Central Bank.\n\nThe Bundesbank has to fulfil its stability mandate, as  defined  above,  in  several ways.  Its  first  and  most  crucial  task  is  to  conduct  its  own  monetary  policy  in  line  with  its anti-inflationary stance. It does have to play its part in achieving the other targets of the Stability and  Growth  Act  (high  level  of  employment,  external  equilibrium  and  stable  and  adequate economic growth), but only to the extent that this does not jeopardise its primary goal of price stability. Since there is a large measure of consensus among economists that price stability is not --  at  least  in  the  medium  term  --  inconsistent  with  the  other  targets  of  the  so-called  uneasy quadrangle, but is, instead, a prerequisite for continued growth, high employment and external equilibrium,  there  should  not  actually  be  any  conflict  in  this  respect.  An  anti-inflationary monetary  policy  also  serves  other  macroeconomic  goals,  the  example  of  Germany  providing ample evidence of this. Although a stable currency alone cannot automatically bring about and safeguard sustained growth and increased employment,  it  is  an  indispensable  precondition  for them. Furthermore, experience has shown  that monetary stability also makes a major contribution to social  equity.  Given  the  demographic  trends,  not  only  in  Germany  but  also  in other  European  countries,  this  will  be  all  the  more  the  case  in  the  future,  since  private provisioning by the 'ordinary citizens' will become increasingly important.\n\n## Role as a guardian of monetary stability\n\nIn  the  final  analysis,  however,  monetary  stability  cannot  be  safeguarded  by  an anti-inflationary monetary  policy  alone.  It will always  be influenced by the prevailing behavioural  patterns  in  society  and  by  developments  in  other  policy  areas.  This  applies,  in particular, to those decisions taken in fiscal policy, labour market policy, social policy and wage policy  which  affect  the  viability  of  the  economic  and  social  system.  Long-term  undesirable trends in those areas also tend to jeopardise monetary stability in the short or long run, and then often  require  monetary  policy  countermeasures.  For  that  reason,  the  Bundesbank's  role  as  a guardian of monetary stability must of necessity extend beyond its decision-making powers in monetary policy. It has to draw attention -- at as early a stage as possible -- to potential risks to stability  in  other  areas  and  parallel  behavioural  patterns  in  the  economy  or  in  society.  The Bundesbank has always made every possible effort to do this, without interfering in the political discussion of specific details.\n\nThe Bundesbank is also especially suited to this more far-reaching function as a guardian  of  stability  on  account  of  the  fact  that  the  legislature  has  kept  it  largely  free  of day-to-day  political  influence  and  special  party  and  lobby  interests  by  virtue  of  its  being independent  of  political  instructions  and  by  the  long-term  appointment  of  the  members  of  its governing bodies. Being free of short-term party and special interests, the Bundesbank is hence able  to  raise  its  warning  voice  --  which  it  has  always  done  in  the  almost  forty  years  of  its existence -- if it perceives the emergence of national or international risks to monetary stability.\n\nHowever, the political independence of the Bundesbank by no means implies that it is free of responsibilities. In contrast to many other countries, it is not -- for well considered\n\nreasons  --  accountable  to  the  government  or  to  parliament.  Nevertheless,  from  the  very beginning it has placed itself under the obligation publicly to explain and justify its policy as well as its assessment of developments that are relevant to monetary policy. Its target group is the  general  public  which  it  addresses  through  the  speeches  of  the  members  of  its  governing bodies and its diverse publications, especially its Monthly and Annual Reports. The Bundesbank uses all these opportunities to  explain  its  policy  and  the  reasons  behind  its  decisions.  It  hence puts itself before the forum of public discussion.\n\n## Role of a monetary policy adviser ...\n\nFurthermore, the Bundesbank has been assigned a specific advisory role vis-à-vis the  Federal  Cabinet  by  the  legislature.  In  accordance  with  article  13,  the  Bundesbank  has  to 'advise  the  Federal  Cabinet  on  monetary  policy  matters  of  major  importance'.  This  advisory role  has  often  been  quite  significant  in  the  history  of  the  Bundesbank.  It  not  only  played  a considerable  part  in  all  the  discussions  on  the  design  and  application  of  the  international  and European monetary system. At the request of the Federal Cabinet, the Bundesbank also advised it in connection with preparing for German monetary union. Naturally, the political bodies were and remain free to follow the advice given by the Bundesbank or not. In fulfilling its political responsibilities,  the  Federal  Cabinet  departed  from  the  Bundesbank's  recommendations  on individual points (e.g. in the selection of the conversion rate for current payments).\n\n## ... in the Maastricht negotiations ...\n\nThe  Bundesbank  also  performed  its  advisory  function  in  connection  with  the negotiations on the Maastricht Treaty. As long ago as September 1990, the Central Bank Council drew attention to what it deemed to be the key issues in a memorandum. It said, among other things, '... the participating economies (i.e. in the monetary union) will be inextricably linked to one another in the monetary field, come what may. The implications of this -- especially for the value  of  money  --  will  depend  crucially  on  economic  and  fiscal  policy  and  on  the  stance  of management  and  labour  in  all  member  states.'  And  then  the  indispensable  benchmarks  of  a successful stability union are spelled out in detail: from an independent central banking system, with  a  priority  commitment  to  the  target  of  price  stability,  via  the  regulations  for  lasting budgetary discipline, to the requirements for sufficient and durable policy convergence among the participating countries prior to entry into the final stage.\n\nIn addition, Bundesbank representatives, through their work on the EU Monetary Committee in  Brussels  and  on  the  erstwhile  Committee  of  Central  Bank  Governors  in  Basle, contributed  to  the  wording  of  the  Maastricht  Treaty  in  numerous  instances.  For  example,  the statute of the European Central Bank was drafted largely by representatives of European central banks  in  Basle  and  then  adopted,  virtually  unchanged,  by  government  representatives  in  the Treaty negotiations. Parallel to the negotiations in Brussels and Maastricht, there were of course also  repeated  bilateral  talks  between  the  Bundesbank  and  the  Federal  Government  on  major aspects of the Treaty.\n\nThese intensive and close contacts were and are fully in line with the Bundesbank's statutory mandate to proffer advice. Equally, attention should be drawn to the fact that  this  does  not  affect  the  Government's  political  accountability.  It  was  not  and  is  not  the\n\nBundesbank that conducted or conducts negotiations itself on these subjects. Incidentally, neither was  it  the  Bundesbank  that  was  responsible  for  the  numerical  fixing  of  the  so-called  fiscal criteria  at  3  %  of  GDP  for  the  current  budget  deficit  and  at  60  %  of  GDP  for  the  fiscal  debt level.  To  my  knowledge,  both  figures,  which  in  the  eyes  of  the  Bundesbank  tend  to  be  too generous, rather than too strict, for most countries, were put forward by delegations other than the German one. In the joint estimation of the Central Bank Council, however, it is imperative that,  prior  to  entry  into  monetary  union,  'the  budget  deficits  in  all  the  participating  countries should be reduced to a level which is sustainable in the long run and unproblematic in terms of anti-inflation policy requirements'.\n\nAfter  the  conclusion  of  the  Treaty  negotiations,  the  Central  Bank  Council published the following evaluation of the Treaty early in 1992: 'The question of whether EMU is to be established is a political decision. ... The planned institutional design of the final stage is largely in line with the Bundesbank's recommendations. In particular, the statute of the future European System of Central Banks ... It will be of paramount importance for the overall success of the envisaged economic and monetary union that the Community decisions to be taken in ... 1998 on the selection of the countries eligible for participation should be geared solely to their stability policy performance.'\n\n## ... in the preparations for EMU\n\nIn  line  with  its  statutory  mandate,  the  Bundesbank  is  also  advising  the  Federal Government  in  the  current  negotiations  on  the  preparation  of  monetary  union.  That  applies particularly  to  the  consultations  on  the  legal  texts  for  what  is  known  as  the  'secondary legislation'  now  taking  shape  in  Brussels.  And  it  also  applies  to  the  proposal  for  a  European stability  pact  (which  was  put  forward  by  the  Federal  Government  and backed  by  the Bundesbank)  to  concretise  the  surveillance  process  for  budgetary  and  debt  trends  in  the participating countries envisaged in article 104c of the Treaty. That stability pact has nothing to do with any German desire for hegemony. Instead, it is intended to prevent potential conflicts from  arising  between  the  future  single  stability-oriented  monetary  policy  and  fiscal  policy (especially the fiscal policies of the major member states), thus protecting the smaller member states, in particular, from hardships imposed by the potential misconduct of the larger ones.\n\nUrging  'strict'  compliance  with  the  contractual  convergence  criteria  in  the selection decision by the European Council on the member states participating in the monetary union beginning in 1999 -- as reflected in the evaluation of the Treaty published early in 1992 -is, after all, part of the Bundesbank's function of being a guardian of price stability and advisor. The  calls  made  by  the  Bundesbank  --  incidentally,  in  complete  agreement  with  the  Federal Government -- for a 'strict' interpretation of the criteria laid down in the Treaty are by no means merely legalistic. Just like the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, the Bundesbank regards strict and lasting  compliance  with  the  convergence  criteria  as  an  essential  precondition  for  the  smooth inception and, as far as possible, conflict-free continuation of monetary union.\n\n## Lasting convergence indispensable\n\nReferences to the fact that today there is not infrequently divergence, rather than convergence, within existing monetary areas disregard the fundamental difference that obtains between a monetary area that is identical to the borders of a nation state and a monetary union, which comprises several nation states with a different regulatory and social systems. After all, in\n\nBIS Review   141/1996\n\na monetary union extending beyond the frontiers of a single nation state, the common features and compensatory systems which regularly exist within a nation state (such as a common legal and  tax  system,  a  dominant  central  government  budget,  common  social  security  systems  and fiscal  adjustment  mechanisms)  are  missing.  Hence  in  a  monetary  union  composed  of  several member states without superordinate national ties, the potentially diverging forces are far greater than in a nation state. It would be a fallacy to suppose that a common central banking system alone  can  prevent  potential  divergencies  in  a  union  comprising  several  major  member  states. This is why a monetary union encompassing several nation states entails from the outset a high level  of  common  'stability  culture',  in  the  sense  of  joint  preferences  and  tried-and-tested capabilities.  The  degree  of  lasting  convergence  achieved  and  the  readiness  to  maintain  lasting financial discipline are intended to document precisely that. Disregarding the significance of the selection  criteria  and  lastingly  failing  to  acknowledge  it  would  imply  a  lack  of  strategic perceptiveness, and not vice versa. A monetary union which later turned out to be particularly conflict-prone, let alone fragile, would not only pose economic problems, it might even turn out to be  a serious threat to the European  integration  process. Drawing  attention  to these far-reaching  political  dangers,  and  thus  to  the  crucial  importance  of  selecting  countries  in keeping with the criteria, is undoubtedly part and parcel of the Bundesbank's advisory mandate. After  all,  the  monetary  union  must  not  be  allowed  to  fail,  let  alone  to  become  a  source  of political conflict in Europe.\n\n## Not a 'state within the state'\n\nAll in all, the Bundesbank has constantly endeavoured to perform its role of being a guardian and advisor in keeping with its stability target, as laid down by Parliament -- and it will  continue  to  do  so.  In  the  basic  orientation  of  its  policy  it  knows  at  the  same  time  that  it enjoys a consensus with the vast majority of the population. The performance of these duties by the Bundesbank, like its monetary policy, which is geared primarily to domestic price stability, has nothing to do with any stance as a 'state within the state'. Nor does it have anything to do with  a  desire  for  German  hegemony  in  Europe.  Quite  the  contrary,  a  lastingly  sustainable foundation and an anti-inflationary orientation of the monetary union are without any doubt in the best interests of Europe, too.\n\nIt  may well be that such a stability-oriented  guardian  and  advisor  function  does not always fit in with the political and tactical aspirations of the political decision-makers. That may even be true at times of our trading partners. But Chancellor Kohl rightly said publicly not long ago: 'As the Federal Chancellor, I sometimes have problems with individual measures or statements by the Bundesbank. But as a citizen of this country, I am happy that the Bundesbank exists and that it acts in this way. Of course, neither the Bundesbank nor its President can claim always to take the right action in all circumstances'.\n\nOn taking office in 1993 I said: 'Even the Bundesbank is not faultless'. Needless to say, that is just as true today, and will remain so in future. But the fact that the Bundesbank is attested a substantial measure of 'credibility in anti-inflation policy' in Germany, in Europe and in international circles alike has certainly done Germany and Europe as a whole more good than harm.  That  verdict  has  been  confirmed  time  and  again  by  impartial  observers.  Hence  the Bundesbank will also continue to feel itself committed to stability in the period ahead.",

         "Address by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Mr. C. Rangarajan, at the Second Conference of the Econometric Society's Regional Chapter for India and South Asia in Delhi on 28/12/96.",
         "- Mr.  Rangarajan  examines  the  objectives  of  monetary  policy  and  price stability in relation to the economy of India Address by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India,  Mr.  C.  Rangarajan,  at  the  Second  Conference  of  the  Econometric  Society's  Regional Chapter for India and South Asia in Delhi on 28/12/96.\n1. It gives me indeed very great pleasure to be in your midst this morning.  It is  indeed  very  gratifying  to  note  that  the  Second  Conference  of  the  Econometric  Society's Regional Chapter for India and South East Asia is being held in Delhi.\n2. Econometrics  as  a  discipline  has  come  a  long  way.    Enriched  by  the developments both in mathematical economics and statistical methods, econometrics has today become an indispensable tool to all practitioners. Without a numerical evaluation of economic magnitudes, economic theory would have been of little use in economic policy.  The original motto of Cowles Foundation was 'Science is measurement'.  It used to be said that in economics the  tendency  of  theory  to  lag  behind  observations  seemed  to  be  endemic.  We  have  definitely moved away from that situation.  While alternative theories to explain a set of phenomena are not  necessarily  a  weakness  and  may  even  be  regarded  as  a  sign  of  vitality,  the  continued co-existence  of  alternative  theories  over  a  substantial  period  of  time  without  being  able  to discriminate among them can result in the loss of credibility in the discipline itself. This in part is the present status of economics.  The future scope of econometrics is thus immense.\n3. I would like to take this opportunity given to me this morning to raise one issue in monetary policy that still remains contentious despite overwhelming agreement among policy makers in industrially advanced countries.  The issue relates to the objective of monetary policy.    The  question  is: What  should  be  the  objective  or  objectives  of  monetary  policy  and whether in the Indian context, maintenance of price stability should be the dominant objective of monetary policy?\n4. The  issue  of  objective  has  become  important  because  of  the  need  to provide  clear  guidance  to  monetary  policy  makers.  Indeed  this  aspect  has  assumed  added significance  in  the  context  of  the  increasing  stress  on  autonomy  of  central  banks.    While autonomy  has  to  go  with  accountability,  accountability  itself  requires  a  clear  enunciation  of goals.\n5. Monetary  policy  has  now  moved  to  the  centre  stage  of  economic policy-making the world over. In the 1930s and in the first two decades after the Second World War, monetary policy was relegated to the background.  The ascendancy of fiscal policy during this  period  was  due  in  part  to  the  depression  of  the  1930s,  and  the  process  of  reconstruction immediately after the Second World War and the acceptance of the Keynesian dictum that fiscal action was necessary to prevent deficiency in the aggregate demand.  However, the 1970s saw the emergence of a combination of high inflation and low growth - 'stagnation' as it came to be called  -  and  the  standard  Keynesian  analysis  was  hard  put  to  explain  that  phenomenon. Consequently, monetary policy re-emerged as an instrument of economic policy particularly in the fight against inflation. Issues relating to the conduct of monetary policy came to the forefront of  policy  debates  in  the  1980s.    The  relative  importance  of  growth  and  price  stability  as  the objective of monetary policy as well as the appropriate intermediate target of monetary policy became the focus of attention. Over the years, a consensus has emerged among the industrially advanced  countries  that  the  dominant  objective  of  monetary  policy  should  be  price  stability. Incorporation of this objective in the Maastrischt Treaty is indeed a reflection of this consensus. Differences  however,  exist  among  central  banks  even  in  industrially  advanced  countries  as regards  the  appropriate  intermediate  target.    While  some  central  banks  consider  monetary\n\naggregates  and  therefore  monetary  targeting  as  operationally  meaningful,  some  others  focus exclusively on interest rate  even  though  the  inter-relationship  between  the  two  targets  is  well recognised.\n\n6. A  similar  trend  regarding  monetary  policy  is  discernible  in  developing economies  as  well.  Much  of  the  early  literature  on  development  economics  focused  on  real factors  such  as  savings,  investment  and  technology  as  main  springs  of  growth.  Very  little attention was paid to the financial system as a contributory factor to economic growth.  In fact, many  writers  felt  that  inflation  was  endemic  in  the  process  of  economic  growth  and  it  was accordingly  treated  more  as  a  consequence  of  structural  imbalance  than  as  a  monetary phenomenon.  However, with the accumulated evidence,  it  became    clear  that  any  process  of economic  growth  in  which  monetary  expansion  was  disregarded  also  led  to  inflationary pressures  with  a  consequent  impact  on  economic  growth.  Accordingly,  importance  of  price stability and therefore the need to use monetary policy for that purpose also assumed importance in developing economies. Nonetheless, the debate on the extent to which price stability should be deemed to be the over-riding objective of monetary policy in such economies continues.\n7. Monetary  policy  is  an  arm  of  economic  policy  and  in  that  sense,  the objectives of monetary policy are no different from the overall objectives of economic policy. The broad objectives of monetary policy in India have been\n- a) to  regulate  monetary  expansion  so  as  to  maintain  a  reasonable  degree  of  price stability; and\n- b) to ensure adequate expansion in credit to assist economic growth.\n\nThe  emphasis  between  the  two  objectives  has  changed  from  year  to  year depending upon the conditions prevailing in that and the previous year.\n\n8. The  question  of  a  dominant  objective  arises  essentially  in  view  of  the multiplicity  of  objectives  and  the  inherent  conflict  among  such  objectives.  Jan  Tinbergen  had argued decades ago that it was necessary to have at least one instrument for each target.  In this regard,  it  must  be  recognised  that  certain  objectives  are  better  suited  or  more  easily  achieved with certain instruments than with others. This 'assignment rule' favours monetary policy as the most appropriate instrument to achieve the objective of price stability.\n9. The crucial question that arises is whether the pursuit of the objective of price  stability  by  monetary  authorities  undermines  the  ability  of  the  economy  to  attain  and sustain higher growth. A great deal of research effort has been spent on the examination of the trade-off between economic growth and price stability.\n10. The  well known  Phillips curve showed  that there was  an inverse relationship between rate of change in wage rate and unemployment rate suggesting thereby a trade-off  between  inflation  and  unemployment.  The  original  article  of  Prof.  Phillips  was published in 1958. The Phillips curve relationship has subsequently been challenged both from theoretical and empirical standpoints.  The downward slope of the curve arises basically because of the presence of money illusion and expected inflation deviating from actual inflation.\n11. At  present  the  controversy  is  centred  around  the  possible  short-run  and long-run 'trade-off' between inflation and unemployment.  This distinction primarily stems from\n\nthe  assumption  of  'error-learning'  process  in  the  determination  of  inflationary  expectations  workers  do  have  an  anticipation  on  the  inflation,  but  because  they  judge  the inflation performance  from  the  past  data,  the  adjustment  between  the  expected  and  actual  inflation  is slow.  This  implies  that  in  the  short-run,  nominal  wage  rise  will  not  fully  absorb  the  actual inflation, and as such, it is argued, there is scope for reducing unemployment through inflation. As people adjust their expectations of inflation, the short-run Phillips curve shifts upward and the unemployment rate returns towards its 'natural' level.  As the expected inflation catches up with actual inflation, the Phillips curve becomes vertical, denying thereby a 'trade-off' between inflation and unemployment in the long run. The Phillips curve thus provides at best a temporary trade-off  between  inflation  and  unemployment  when  the  economy  is  adjusting  to  shocks  to aggregate demand and as long as expected inflation is lower than actual inflation. The long-run Phillips curve becomes almost vertical at the natural rate of unemployment.\n\n12. Of course, there is a possibility  of  lengthening  the  short-run  'trade-offs' indefinitely, since inflation surprises in each period can elongate the long-run perpetually. But, in that case the 'trade-offs' will become sharper in each successive period.  In other words, to maintain the unemployment below the 'natural' rate, policy authorities will have to inflate the economy at higher rates in each successive period.  This has a major policy implication even if the  economy  does  not  operate  on  the  long-run  vertical  Phillips  curve.    Under  the  'rational expectations hypothesis', as there are no deviations between 'actual', and 'expected' inflation, both in the short-run and long-run, Phillips curves are treated as being vertical with no trade-off between inflation and unemployment.\n13. Another policy related question is the shape of the short-run Phillips curve itself. In the real world wages and prices remain sticky, as employment contracts are fairly long and there is also a cost in changing the individual prices too often, or renegotiating wages each time after a price rise. As argued by Fischer (1994), the nature of stickiness in wages and prices could be different in different economies and this could also be a function of the inflation history of  the  country  concerned.    Countries  with  high  inflation  rates  tend  to  find  themselves  on  the steeper portion of the short-run Phillips curve than low inflation countries which are more likely to be on the flatter side. Therefore, 'trade-off' between price stability and employment or output even when it does exist, is sharper for countries with relatively high inflation rates than those with low inflation rates.\n14. The case of price stability as the objective of monetary policy rests on the fact that volatility in prices creates uncertainty in decision making. Rising prices affect savings adversely while making speculative investments more attractive. The most important contribution of the financial system to an economy is its ability to augment savings and allocate resources more efficiently.  A regime of rising prices vitiates the atmosphere for promotion of savings and allocation of investment.  Apart from all of these, there is also a social dimension. Inflation affects adversely those who have no hedges against inflation and that includes all the poorer sections of the community. Of course, a critical question in this context is at what level of inflation the adverse consequences begin to set in.\n15. Inflation affects fiscal balance in several ways.  It adversely affects fiscal deficit  when  elasticity  of  expenditure  to  inflation  is  higher  than  that  of  revenue.    A  more significant impact  of inflation arises from  its effect on interest rate  and  the  dynamic sustainability  of  the  fiscal  situation.    High  rates  of  inflation  signal  weak  resolve  to  control inflation  and  imply  higher  expected  inflation  in  future.    This  gives  rise  to  upward  rigidity  in nominal  interest  and  leads  to  high  debt  service  burden  on  the  budget,  thus  reducing  the manoeuvrability of fiscal management.\n\n16. It  is  well  recognised  that  adverse  implications  of  inflation  are  higher  at high rates  of  inflation,  while  a  moderate  inflation  rate  could  be  manageable  without  implying severe  costs.    International  evidence  suggests  that  the  costs  of  uncertainty  tend  to  rise  in  a non-linear  fashion  with inflation rate exceeding  a  threshold.    One  important  caveat  in interpreting the threshold of inflation rate beyond which costs exceed benefit is the provision of inflation  protection  measures  available  in  the  economy,  which  tends  to  moderate  the  adverse implications to some extent.  Countries with a moderate inflation rate but inadequate indexation provision may show  a  higher  degree  of  sensitivity  to  inflation,  than  those  with  low  inflation. Most of the industrialised countries in the recent years have moved into an inflation rate ranging between  two  to  three  per  cent.    Among  the  developing  countries,  some  of  the  fast  growing East-Asian  economies  have  in  recent  years  not  only  demonstrated  low  inflation  rates  ranging between three to five per cent, but the growth rate at these inflation rates has been fairly high at around eight per cent.\n\n17. Empirical evidence on the relationship between the inflation and growth in  cross-country  frameworks is somewhat inconclusive  because  such  studies  include  countries with inflation rate of as low as one to two per cent as well as countries with inflation rates going beyond  200  and  300  per  cent.  While  a  number  of  studies  have  concluded  that  the  negative impact of inflation on growth is high at high rates of inflation, there is no consensus about the threshold  inflation  rate  beyond  which  the  negative  impact  becomes  pronounced.    A  study  by Bruno indicated that growth rates declined steeply as the inflation rate went beyond 25 per cent. Another  study  also  based  on  cross  section  of  countries  reported  that  the  negative  effect  of inflation was very pronounced and powerful at inflation rates exceeding eight per cent. What the appropriate inflation threshold beyond which costs tend to exceed benefits need to be estimated for  each  country  separately.  Nevertheless,  people  worry  about  even  moderate  inflation  levels because if not held in check, a little inflation can lead to higher inflation and eventually affect growth.\n\n18. A macro-econometric model of the Indian economy shows that a 10 per cent sustained increase in real public investment in non-agriculture sector, financed by money creation leads to an annual inflation rate of about 2.3 per cent and additional GDP growth of one percent, on an average, during the first two years, while in the span of 10 to 15 years, inflation rate rises to about 17 per cent per annum and additional output growth slows down considerably to  average  2.7  per  cent  during  this  period.    This  implies  that  in  the  long  run  a  sustained improvement in the growth scenario through monetary financing of the deficit could involve a severe  trade-off  in  terms  of  inflation  -  every  one  per  cent  additional  output  growth  implies nearly 6 to 6.5 per cent rise in inflation rate in the long run.\n\n19. Obviously,  there  are  some  critics  of  price  stability  as  the  dominant objective of monetary policy.  For example Prof. Paul Krugman writes\n\n'.....the belief that absolute price stability is a huge blessing, that it brings large  benefits  with  few  if  any  costs,  rests  not  on  evidence  but  on  faith.    The  evidence actually  points  the  other  way:  the  benefits  of  price  stability  are  elusive,  the  costs  of getting there are large, and zero inflation may not be a good thing even in the long run.'\n\nThe observations of Prof. Krugman as they stand  are  not  directed  against  price stability as an objective but are aimed against a policy which seeks 'absolute' price stability and attempts  to  bring  down  the  inflation  rate  from  around  two  per  cent  to  almost  zero.    This  is evident from what he himself advocates:\n\n- '.....adopt as a long run target fairly low but not zero inflation, say threefour  per  cent.    This  is  high  enough  to  accommodate  most  of  the  real  wage  cuts  that markets impose, while the costs of the inflation itself will still be very small.\n\nInterestingly, in India, the Chakravarty Committee (1985) treated an inflation rate of four per cent as 'the acceptable rise in prices' purported to reflect 'changes in relative prices necessary to attract resources to growth sectors'.\n\n20. We, in India, need to have an appropriate fix on the acceptable level of inflation rate.  In the 1970s, the average annual inflation rate as measured by the wholesale price index was nine per cent.  In the 1980s, it was eight per cent.  However, in the period between 1990 and 1995, the average inflation rate has remained around 10 per cent.  The objective of the policy should be to keep the inflation rate around six per cent.  This itself is much higher than what  the  industrial  countries  are  aiming  at  and  therefore  will  have  some  implications  for  the exchange rate of the rupee.  Monetary growth should be so moderated that while meeting the objective of growth it does not push the inflation rate beyond six per cent.\n21. A question that arises in this context is whether monetary policy by itself is able to contain inflationary pressures particularly in developing economies like ours.  It is true that  developing  economies  like  India  are  subject  to  greater  supply  shocks  than  developed economies.  Fluctuations in agricultural output have an important bearing on the price situation. Nevertheless, continuous increase in prices which is what inflation is about cannot occur unless it is sustained by a continuing increase in money supply. Control of the money supply has thus to play an important role in any scheme aimed at controlling inflation.\n21. The controversy over the objective of monetary policy has reached such a pitch that some have described central bankism as a religion with hard money as supreme god and inflation as devil.  Let me however say that the commitment to a reasonable degree of price stability is not a dogma.  It is good economics.",

         "Remarks by Mr. Laurence H. Meyer, a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the AEA Panel on Monetary and Fiscal Policy held in New Orleans on 5/1/97.",
         "Mr.  Meyer  examines  the  role  for  structural  macroeconomic  models  in  the monetary policy process Remarks  by  Mr.  Laurence  H.  Meyer,  a  member  of  the  Board  of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the AEA Panel on Monetary and Fiscal Policy held in New Orleans on 5/1/97.\n\n## The Role for Structural Macroeconomic Models\n\nI  am  in  the  middle  of  my  third  interesting  and  active  encounter  with  the development and/or use  of  macroeconometric  models  for  forecasting  and  policy  analysis.  My journey began at MIT as a research assistant to Professors Franco Modigiliani and Albert Ando during  the  period  of  development  of  the  MPS  model,  continued  at  Laurence  H.  Meyer  &amp; Associates  with  the  development  of  The  Washington  University  Macro  Model  under  the direction of my partner, Joel Prakken, and the use of that model for both forecasting and policy analysis,  and  now  has  taken  me  to  the  Board  of  Governors  where  macro  models  have  long played an important role in forecasting and policy analysis and the MPS model has recently been replaced by the FRB-US model.\n\nI bring to this panel a perspective shaped by both my earlier experience and my new responsibilities. I will focus my presentation on the role of structural macro models in the monetary policy process, compare the use of models at the Board with their use at Laurence H. Meyer &amp; Associates, and discuss how the recently introduced innovations in the Federal Reserve model might further advance the usefulness of models in the monetary policy process.\n\n## I. Structural Models and Monetary Policy Analysis\n\nI want to focus on three contributions of models to the monetary policy process: as an input to the forecast process; as a vehicle for analyzing alternative scenarios; and a vehicle for  developing  a  strategy  for  implementing  monetary  policy  that  disciplines  the  juggling  of multiple objectives and ensures a bridge from short-run policy to long-run objectives.\n\n## 1. The forecast context for monetary policy decisions\n\nBecause monetary policy has the ability to adjust quickly to changing economic conditions and because lags in the response to monetary policy make it important that monetary policy be forward-looking, monetary policy is very much influenced both by incoming data and by  forecasts  of  spending  and  price  developments.  Forecasts  are  central  to  monetary  policy setting.  Models  make  a  valuable  contribution  to  forecasting.  Therefore,  models  can  make  an important contribution to the setting of monetary policy.\n\nModels capture historical regularities, identify key assumptions that must be made to condition the forecast, embody estimates of the effects of past and future policy actions on the economy, and provide a disciplined approach to learning from past errors. I attribute much of the forecasting success of myself and my partners at LHM&amp;A to the way in which we allowed our model to discipline our judgment in making the forecast. A model also helps to defend and communicate  the  forecast,  by  providing  a  coherent  story  that  ties  together  the  details  of  the forecast.  It  also  helps  to  isolate  the  source  of  disagreements  about  the  forecast,  helping  to separate differences in assumptions (oil prices, fiscal policy, etc.) from disagreements about the structure  of  the  economy  or  judgments  about  special  factors  that  the  model  may  not  fully capture.\n\nBIS Review   1/1997\n\nAt the Board, the staff forecast, presented in the Green Book prior to each of the eight  FOMC  meetings  each  year,  is  fundamentally  judgmental.  It  is  developed  by  a  team  of sector  specialists  who  consult,  but  are  not  bound  by,  a  number  of  structural  econometric equations  describing  their  sectors,  and  further  armed,  in  some  cases,  with  reduced-form equations and atheoretical time series models. The team develops the forecast within the context of agreed-upon conditioning assumptions, including, for example, a path for short-term interest rates,  fiscal  policy,  oil  prices,  and  foreign  economic  policies.  They  begin  with  an  income constraint  and  then  participate  in  an  interactive  process of revisions to ensure  that  the aggregation of sector forecasts is consistent with the evolving forecast for the overall level of output.\n\nModels play an important supporting role in the development of the staff forecast. A separate model group uses a formal structural macroeconometric model, the FRB-US Model, to  make a 'pure model' forecast which is also  available  to  the  FOMC  and  is  an  input  to  the judgmental forecast process. The model forecast is conditioned by the same set of assumptions as  the  judgmental  forecast  and  statistical  models  are  used  to  generate  the  path  of  adjustment factors, avoiding any role for judgment in the forecast. The members of the model group also actively participate in the discussions as the judgmental forecast evolves, focusing in particular on  the  consistency  between  the  adjustment  factors  that  would  be  required  to  impose  the judgmental  forecast  on  the  model  and  the  pattern  of  adjustment  factors  in  the  'pure'  model forecast.\n\nThere  are  two  important  differences  from  the  private  sector  use  of  models  for forecasting, at least based on my experience at LHM&amp;A. First, the staff is not truly making a forecast of economic activity, prices, etc., because the staff forecast is usually conditioned on an unchanged path of the funds rate. Thus the staff is projecting how the economy would evolve if there were no change in the federal funds rate (which does not even always translate cleanly into no  change  in  monetary  policy).  The  rationale  for  this  procedure  is  to  separate  the  forecast process from the policy-making process, and therefore avoid appearing to prejudge the FOMC's decisions. This procedure may be modified when there is a strong presumption that conditions will unambiguously call for significant action if the Committee is to achieve its objectives. But it does, nevertheless, make the forecast process at the Board fundamentally different from that in the  private  sector  where  one  of  the  key  decisions  in  the  forecast  is  the  direction  of  monetary policy. It is ironic that, at the Board, where the staff is presumably more knowledgeable about the  direction  of  policy  than  in  the  private  sector,  forecasting  is  constrained  from  using  that information in developing the forecast. On the other hand, the practice at the Board may be very well suited to the process of making policy by forcing the FOMC to confront the implications of maintaining an unchanged path for the funds rate.\n\nA second difference relative to my experience in the private sector has to do with the  way  in  which  judgment  and  model  interact  in  the  development  of  the  forecast.  My  first impression of the process at the Board was that the judgmental team made its forecast without a model and the model team made its forecast without judgment, leaving the blending of model and  judgment  to  be  worked  out  in  the  process  of  discussion  and  iteration  as  the  judgmental group looks at the model output and the model group joins the discussion of the forecast. The process  is,  I  have  come  to  appreciate,  more  complicated  and  subtle  than  this  caricature.  For example,  when  there  have  been  important  shocks  (e.g.,  unexpected  rise  in  oil  prices  or  an increase  in  the  minimum  wage),  model  simulations  of  the  effect  of  the  shocks  will  provide  a point of departure for the initial judgmental forecast. But it is, nevertheless, a different way of combining  model  and  judgment  than  we  used  at  LHM&amp;A  where  the  model  played  a  more central role in the forecast process. An advantage of the Board's approach is that it makes the\n\nforecast less dependent on a single model (perhaps desirable given the diversity of views on the FOMC) and forces recognition of  uncertainties  in  the  outlook  when  alternative  sector  models yield very different forecasts.\n\n## 2. Policy alternatives and alternative scenarios to support FOMC policy decisions\n\nA  second  valuable  contribution  of  models  is  to  provide  alternative  scenarios around a base forecast. I will focus on three examples of this use of models at the Board, though there  is  also,  of  course,  widespread  use  of  alternative  model-based  scenario  analysis  in  the private sector.\n\nFirst,  the  staff  regularly  provides  alternative  forecasts  roughly  corresponding  to the  policy  options  that  will  be  considered  at  the  upcoming  FOMC  meeting.  The  staff  first imposes  the  judgmental  forecast  on  the  FRB-US  model  and  then  uses  the  model  to  provide alternative scenarios for a policy of rising rates and a policy of declining rates, bracketing the staff forecast which assumes an unchanged federal funds rate. While this is the most direct use of  the  model  in  the  forecast  process,  it  is  recognized  that  it  has  become  a  problematical  one, especially  given  the  structure  of  the  new  FRB-US  model  that  otherwise  treats  policy  as determined by a rule, a prerequisite to the forward-looking approach to expectations formation that is a major innovation in the new model. Indeed, it might well be that the presentation of a forecast that incorporates a simple monetary policy rule might be a more useful complement to the staff's judgmental forecast than the mechanical bracketing of the judgmental forecast with pre-determined paths of rising or falling rates.\n\nSecond, the staff, on occasion, uses the model to provide information about the projected effects of significant contingencies: e.g., the return of Iraq to oil exporting under the U.N. agreement for humanitarian aid or the effect of an increase in the minimum wage. Models are particularly well suited to providing this information.\n\nThird,  the  model  can  be  used  to  evaluate  the  consistency  of  alternative  policies with  the  Federal  Reserve's  long-run  objective  of  price  stability.  One  of  the  challenges  of monetary policy making is to ensure that the meeting-to-meeting policy deliberations maintain a disciplined focus on the Federal Reserve's long-term price stability objective. To facilitate this focus, five-year simulations under alternative policy assumptions are generally run semi-annually, to coincide with the FOMC  meetings  preceding  the preparation of the Humphrey-Hawkins report and the Chairman's testimony on monetary policy before Congress. These simulations have recently focused on policy options allowing for more gradual or more rapid convergence over time to long-run inflation targets, allowing the FOMC to focus on both the different time-paths to achieve the long-run objective and the alternative paths of output and employment during the transition to the long-run target.\n\n## 3. Policy rules to inform discretionary monetary policy\n\nA  third  contribution  of  models  to  the  monetary  policy  process  is  through simulations  with  alternative  rules  for  Federal  Reserve  action.  At  LHM&amp;A  we  designed  our model  to  offer  users  four  policy  regimes:  setting  paths  for  the  money  supply,  nonborrowed reserves or the federal funds rate or turning on a reaction function according to which the federal funds  rate  responds  to  developments  in  output,  unemployment  and  inflation.  While  we increasingly used the reaction function in our analysis of alternative fiscal policies, we did not routinely take advantage of the reaction function to forecast monetary policy. Another irony is that  there  is  a  much  more  active  interest  in  the  implications  of  monetary  policy  rules  at  the\n\nBoard,  where  discretionary  policy  is  made,  than  in  the  private  sector,  where  estimated  rules might be effectively used to forecast monetary policy.\n\nThe staff has examined a number of alternative rules, including  those  based  on monetary aggregates, commodity  prices,  exchange  rates,  nominal  income,  and,  most  recently, Taylor-type  rules.  These  rules,  in  effect,  adjust  the  real  federal  funds  rate  relative  to  some long-run  equilibrium  level  in  response  to  the  gaps  between  actual  and  potential  output  and between inflation and some long-run inflation target.\n\nSuch a rule can be interpreted as either a descriptive or normative guide to policy. If the parameters of the policy rule are estimated over some recent sample period, the rule may describe the average response of the FOMC over the period. Alternatively, parameters can be derived from some optimizing framework, dependent on a specific objective function and model of  the  economy.  Stochastic  simulations  with  such  a  rule  can  provide  some  confidence  that following the rule will contribute to both short-run stabilization and long-term inflation goals in response  to  historical  shocks  to  the  economy  and  the  rule,  in  turn,  can  provide  discipline  to discretionary policy by providing guidance on when and how aggressively to move interest rates in response to movements in output and inflation.\n\nThe  focus  on  rules  is  much  more  important  under  an  interest  rate  operating procedure than under an operating procedure focused directly on monetary aggregate targets and is also more important under an interest rate operating procedure when the monetary aggregates, as  has  been  the  case  for  some  time,  do  not  bear  a  stable  relationship  to  overall  economic performance and therefore do not provide useful information about when and how aggressively to change interest rates. Taylor-type rules, in this environment, provide a disciplined approach to varying  interest  rates  in  response  to  economic  developments  that  both  ensures  a  pro-cyclical response of interest  rates  to  demand  shocks  and  imposes  a  nominal  anchor  in  much  the  same way as  would  be  the  case  under  a  monetary  aggregate  strategy  with  a  stable  money  demand function.  For  this  reason,  I  like  to  refer  to  the  strategy  implicit  in  such  rules  as  'monetarism without money.'\n\nThis  should  not  suggest  that  we  can  write  a  rule  that  is  appropriate,  in  all circumstances, to all varieties of shocks, and to all the varieties of cyclical experience. Rules, at best, can discipline  judgment  rather than replace judgment. A  particular  problem  with Taylor-type rules is that we do not know the equilibrium real federal funds rate and, whatever it might be at one point in time, it likely varies over time. There is considerable research under way at the Board in an effort to find specifications and parameters for rules which achieve an efficient balancing of inflation and output variability  and  provide  guidance  about  patterns  and aggressiveness of interest rate adjustments consistent with the stabilizing properties of high-performing rules.\n\n## II. The FRB-US Model: Rational Expectations in a Sticky-Price Model\n\nThe newly redesigned model at the Board, the FRB-US model, replaces the MPS model. The MPS model, developed in the mid to late-1960s, revolutionized macroeconometric modeling and set the standard for a considerable period of time. The Board participated in the development of the MPS model and then became its home and the Board staff  kept  the  faith alive  during  the  lean  years  when  such  models  lost  respectability  in  academic  circles,  even  as their usefulness and value in forecasting and practical policy analysis was growing in the 'real' world.  The  FRB-US  model  retains  much  of  the  underlying  structure  in  terms  of  equilibrium\n\nrelationships  and  even  more  of  the  fundamental  simulation  properties  of  the  MPS  model,  but significantly modernizes the estimation of the model and the treatment of expectations.\n\nThe vision in the new work is to separate macro-dynamics into adjustment cost and expectations formation components, with adjustment costs imposing a degree of inertia and expectations  introducing  a  forward-looking  element  into  the  dynamics.  The  net  result  is  a structure that integrates rational expectations into a sticky-price model. In this respect, the new model follows closely the approach pioneered by John Taylor. Finally, the estimation technique makes use of co-integration and an error-correction framework.\n\nFinancial and exchange rate relationships are based on arbitrage equations, with no  adjustment  costs  but  with  explicitly  forward-looking  expectations.  The  specification  of nonfinancial equations, in contrast, incorporates both adjustment costs and rational expectations.\n\nRational expectations are implemented in two alternative ways. First, expectations can  be  specified  as  'model-consistent'  expectations;  that  is,  the  expectations  about  future inflation can be set to equal future inflation (perfect foresight) through iterative solutions of the model.  Model-consistent  expectations  may,  but  need  not,  assume  that  the  private  sector  has complete knowledge of the policy  rule  being  followed  by  the  Federal  Reserve.  In  the  second approach,  expectations  are  also  viewed  as  being  model-consistent,  but  in  this  case  the  model relevant to expectations is not precisely the same as the FRB-US model. Instead, expectations are formed based on a simpler VAR model of the economy. The VAR model always includes three variables -- the output gap, a short-term interest rate, and inflation. When expectations of additional sector-specific variables are required, the system is expanded to include the additional variable.  A  unique  aspect  of  the  VAR  expectations  is  that  these  equations  also  incorporate explicit forward-looking information through an error-correction specification. For example, the VAR equations include a term for the gap between actual inflation and the public's 'long-run' expectations of inflation, based on survey measures of long-run inflation expectations which, in turn,  might  be  viewed  as  based  on  a  combination  of  the  public's  perception  of  the  Federal Reserve's reaction function, including its tolerance of inflation over the long run. The equations also  include  the  gap  between  actual  short-term  interest  rates  and  the public's  long-run expectations of short-term rates, gleaned from the yield curve.\n\nThe  model  retains  the  neo-Classical  synthesis  vision  of  the  MPS  model  -short-run  output  dynamics based on  sticky  prices  and  long-run  Classical  properties  associated with price flexibility  --  and  therefore  produces  multiplier  results,  both  in  the  short  and  longer runs,  that  are  very  similar  to  those  produced  by  the  MPS  model.  The  result  is  that  the  model produces, for the most part, what may be the best of two worlds - a modern form and traditional results!  But  the  better  articulated  role  of  expectations  in  the  new  model  also  allows  a  richer analysis of the response to those policy actions which might have immediate impacts on inflation and/or interest rate expectations.\n\nThe model has several advantages. The first is it may be more credible to a wider audience because of its modernization in terms of cointegration and error-learning specification on the one hand and explicit use of rational expectations on the other hand. Second, the model is much more flexible in terms of research potential. It allows one to study in particular how the response to monetary or fiscal policies depends on features of the expectation formation process. Third,  the  model  forces  the  user  to  make  assumptions  explicitly  about  expectations  formation that otherwise could be avoided or hidden.\n\nLet me give two examples of policy options that can be analyzed more effectively in  the  new  model.  First,  consider  a  deficit  reduction  package  that  is  credible  and  promises  to lower interest rates in the future. In models like MPS and WUMM, the mechanical fiscal policy simulation would ignore any 'bond market effect' associated with changed expectations about future short-term rates. One could, of course, add-factor downward the long-term bond rate in the term structure equation to impose a bond market effect, but the structure of the model neither immediately points you in this direction nor provides any guidance about how to intervene. In FRB-US, in contrast, one cannot avoid making an explicit assumption about the credibility of such  a policy  (through assumptions  about future short-term interest rates  in  the  VAR expectations or in the context of model-consistent expectations) and the assumption made about credibility will importantly affect the short-run dynamics though not the long-run effects of the policy.\n\nSecond,  consider  the  transitional  costs  of  reducing  inflation.  The  transitional effects  on  output  depend  importantly  on  the  assumptions  made  about  the  credibility  of  the inflation  commitment.  Note,  however,  that  there  are  significant  transitional  output  costs  of disinflation  even  under  full  credibility  and  the  model-consistent  specification  of rational expectations, arising from the sticky price implication of the adjustment cost specification. For my  part,  I  prefer  the  FRB-US  simulations  based  on  limited  rather  than  perfect  credibility, because  I  do  not  believe  that  credibility  effects  significantly  diminish  the  transition  costs  of lowering inflation. But I also value having a disciplined approach to showing how the costs of disinflation would vary with the differing degrees of credibility.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n## References\n\nBrayton,  F.,  A.

         "Dr.  Hämäläinen  reviews  developments  in  the  Finnish  economy  in  1996 Review by the Governor of the Bank of Finland, Dr. Sirkka Hämäläinen, in connection with the Bank of Finland's Annual Accounts.  PRESS RELEASE, 10/1/97.\n\nCoherent economic policies and a stable international environment provided the appropriate conditions for steady growth and balanced performance of the Finnish economy in 1996. The rise in the price level was moderate and exchange rates remained fairly stable. For these reasons, it was possible to lower the instrumental interest rates of monetary policy to levels that were low by both historical and international standards. Long-term market rates followed the  downward trend in short-term rates. Positive outcomes included a reduction in the central government deficit, the end of the banks' protracted series of financial losses and a noticeable improvement in the economy's external indebtedness. High unemployment continued to pose a serious problem.\n\nThe consumer price index rose by about 1 per cent in 1996, and the indicator of underlying  inflation,  which  serves  as  a  basis  for  monetary  policy,  was  even  more  subdued. During the summer and autumn months, a lively public discussion ensued on the possibility of deflation.  There  were  however  no  signs  of  a  general  decline  in  the  price  level,  and  the  entire configuration of asset prices, for example trended upward.\n\nExports and investment provided less-than-expected stimulus to economic growth in 1996, but owing to a healthy rise in private consumption expenditure, total output is estimated to have grown by nearly 3 per cent. The market outlook for exports improved in the latter part of the year. Investment expenditure was buoyed mainly by previously started large-scale investment projects in the manufacturing sector, but construction activity picked up sharply in the  latter  part  of  the  year.  Because  of  a  recovery  in  the  service  and  construction  sectors,  the employment  situation  improved  slightly,  which  had  a  salutary  effect  on  expectations  and demand in the household and corporate sectors.\n\nThe  growth  in  domestic  demand  helped  to  constrain  the  general  government deficit,  i.e.  the  combined  deficit  of  central  and  local  governments  and  social  security  funds. Nonetheless, the central government deficit remained large by both historical and international standards. The indebtedness of households and firms again eased considerably and the external indebtedness of the total economy continued to improve.\n\nThe Bank of Finland continued to relax monetary policy in 1996. In the course of the year, the tender rate was lowered from 4.25 per cent to 3.0 per cent and the financial markets remained calm. The external value of the markka fluctuated to some extent  but  on  the  whole remained relatively stable. As the year progressed, the long-term interest rate  moved considerably  closer  to  the  comparable  German  rate,  and  by  the  final  months  of  the  year  the differential had stabilized at about ½ percentage point.\n\nOne  significant  development  in  1996  was  the  continued  strengthening  of  the banks  and  the  termination  of  a  period  of  several  years  of  negative  financial  results.  The aggregate  result  turned  positive  largely  because  of  reduced  loan  losses  and  lower  cost  levels. Nonetheless, domestic banks' profitability and capital adequacy have still not reached levels that can be considered good by international standards.\n\nImproved  economic  balance  and  steady  economic  policy  enabled  the  Bank  of Finland to make a proposal in October to the Government concerning the joining of the markka to  the  EU's  Exchange  Rate  Mechanism  (ERM).  The  proposal  was  approved  and  negotiations\n\nwith  other  EU  countries  led  to  an  agreed  ECU  central  rate  for  the  markka  of  FIM  5.80661, corresponding  to  a  central  rate  against  the  Deutschemark  of  FIM  3.04.  The  agreed  markka exchange rate configuration vis-à-vis major ERM currencies corresponds to the average level of recent years. After Italy joined the ERM in November, the markka's ECU central rate became FIM 5.85424. Bilateral central rates against other ERM currencies were not affected.\n\nFinland's purpose in joining the ERM was to ensure its eligibility to be among the first  group  of  countries  to  move  into  Stage  Three  of  EMU.  According  to  the  text  of  the Maastricht Treaty, the exchange rate convergence criterion requires exchange rate stability for two years prior to the examination and participation in the ERM. It now appears that the final decision on eligibility for Stage Three of EMU is slated for spring 1998.\n\nAs  the  Bank  of  Finland  reaffirmed  in  connection  with  the  ERM  linkup,  the monetary policy objective remains that of keeping the inflation rate at about 2 per cent, which accords  with  the  major  EU  countries.  Although  the  inflation  objective  is  consistent  with  the stable  exchange rate  objective,  in  the  event  of  a  disturbance,  ERM  participation  would  imply precedence of the exchange rate objective. The ERM's wide (± 15 per cent) fluctuation margins provide  a  good  buffer  against  speculative  activity,  but  clearly  the  need  to  meet  the  EMU exchange rate criterion and to maintain economic balance requires a much more stable course for exchange rates. Continuing progress in balancing central government finances  and maintenance of the moderate cost trend are key factors as regards exchange rate stability.\n\nIt  is  apparent  that  the  easing  of  monetary  policy  and  confidence  in  improving economic prospects will provide support for domestic demand over the future. With exports also picking up again, the growth of total output could reach 4 per cent in 1997. It appears that the rise  in  the  price  level  will  stay  near  the  targeted  level.  The  decline  in  unemployment  should continue but again at a very sluggish pace. In order to accelerate the decline in the unemployment rate, the tax wedge should be narrowed further and the social security and tax systems should be made more work-friendly.\n\nIt appears that Finland will be able to meet all the economic convergence criteria for EMU, i.e. those pertaining to inflation, exchange rates, the long-term interest rate, and the public sector deficit and debt. The decision on which countries are to participate in Stage Three of EMU is to made in spring 1998, only a little over a year from now, and before that time the Act on the Bank of Finland should be amended so that the EMU requirement regarding central bank independence can be fulfilled.\n\nPractical  preparations  within  the  EU  for  Economic  and  Monetary  Union  have progressed according to plans. The Bank of Finland has participated in the work of creating the European System of Central Banks, in both the European Monetary Institute (EMI) and the EU's Monetary Committee. The preparatory work involves inter alia strategy and instruments for the conduct  of  a  single  monetary  policy  as  well  as  detailed  planning  of  the  payment  system. Progress has also been made in specifying the legal status of the single currency - the euro - as well  as  in  the  design  of  euro  notes  and  coins.  Much  work  has  also  been  required  in  the development of an exchange rate system covering both EMU participants and other EU states.\n\nThe Bank of Finland's own preparations for Stage Three of EMU have intensified. The adoption of a single currency requires broad changes in the payment systems of the banks and the Bank of Finland. One major change will be the fusion of national payment systems into an EU-wide payment system. The Bank of Finland supports efficient and secure solutions, which will at the same time provide the best possible environment for Finnish banking and securities\n\nmarkets. Cooperative efforts between the banks and the Bank of Finland have intensified in all areas of concern, and the Bank of Finland is participating in the national EMU project of the Ministry of Finance.\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe Bank of Finland's financial result for 1996 marked a significant improvement over the last several years, which had resulted in an erosion of the Bank's capital position. The primary reason for the improvement was the sale to the state of the Sponda group, which had fallen  to  the  Bank  in  the  wake  of  the  banking  crisis.  In  this  connection,  the  Bank  received repayment  of  a  loan  to  Sponda  and  partial  compensation  for  forgone  interest  income.  Final losses in connection with the takeover of Skopbank were included in the Bank's balance sheet in 1996: the loss of equity capital amounted to about FIM 5 billion.\n\nThe Bank of Finland's result for 1996 after capitalization of prior years' losses not previously recorded in the balance sheet was FIM 3 754 million, which was added to the reserve fund in the balance sheet, thus strengthening the Bank's capital position.\n\nBIS Review   2/1997",

         "Remarks by the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, at the Catholic University of Leuven on 14/1/97.",
         "Mr. Greenspan addresses some key roles of a central bank Remarks by the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, at the Catholic University of Leuven on 14/1/97.\n\nMr. Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, Minister of Budget, Rector Oosterlinck, Professor Peeters, ladies and gentlemen, it is a distinct honor, and a great personal pleasure, to be here today to receive this degree from such a distinguished and \\_ historic university. Central bankers, because of the continuity of our institutions and the nature of our responsibilities, typically are said to take a long-term view. By that, I mean we try to look beyond the current calendar quarter to the next year or maybe even a few years beyond. Standing here in this university, which was founded more than 500 years ago and had already become a leading university in Europe by the 16th century, gives a meaningful perspective to what central bankers consider the longer term.\n\nToday, I shall address the various roles of a central bank encompassing: bank supervision, the provision of financial services, and, of course, monetary policy. I recognize that not all central banks are the same, and in particular that the central bank's role in bank supervision varies considerably from one country to another. However, I view these three elements of a central bank's responsibilities as closely interrelated and mutually supporting, in ways that I will endeavor to elaborate.\n\nBefore doing so, I might note that the global financial environment in which central banks operate has become an increasingly important factor in carrying out our responsibilities. This is obviously true of smaller and more open economies like Belgium, but it is true also of countries like the United States that are sometimes thought to be self-contained. Monetary policy in all countries must take account of its effects on, and feedback from, the rest of the world. Many financial services provided by central banks involve cross-border transactions of one kind or another. These international relationships add still one more degree of complexity to the already complex lives of central bankers. That is one of our challenges.\n\nOne of the rewards is the international cooperation that these complexities have spawned. That process of cooperation has been especially deep and long-standing among central banks of the G-10 countries, but it involves finance ministries and officials from other agencies and other countries, as well. I call this one of the rewards not just because it has enhanced the policy process but also, on a more personal level, because it has enabled me to develop good friendships with many of my counterparts, including Alfons Verplaetse of the National Bank of Belgium.\n\nLet me begin with the fundamental observation, that a nation's sovereign credit rating lies at the base of its current fiscal, monetary, and, indirectly, regulatory policy. When there is confidence in the integrity of government, monetary authorities --the central bank and the finance ministry --can issue unlimited claims denominated in their own currencies and can guarantee or stand ready to guarantee the obligations of private issuers as they see fit. This power has profound implications for both good and ill for our economies.\n\nCentral banks can issue currency, a non-interest-bearing claim on the government, effectively without limit. They can discount loans and other assets of banks or other private depository institutions, thereby converting potentially illiquid private assets into riskless claims on the government in the form of deposits at the central bank.\n\nThat all of these claims on government are readily accepted reflects the fact that a government cannot become insolvent with respect to obligations in its own currency. A fiat money system, like the ones we have today, can produce such claims without limit. To be sure, if a central bank produces too many, inflation will inexorably rise as will interest rates, and economic activity will inevitably be constrained by the misallocation of resources induced by inflation. If it produces too few, the economy's expansion also will presumably be constrained by a shortage of the necessary lubricant for transactions. Authorities must struggle continuously to find the proper balance.\n\nIt was not always thus. For most of the period prior to the early 1930s, obligations of governments in major countries were payable in gold. This meant the whole outstanding debt of government was subject to redemption in a medium, the quantity of which could not be altered at the will of government. Hence, debt issuance and budget deficits were constrained by the potential market response to an inflated economy. It was even possible in such a monetary regime for a government to become insolvent. Indeed, the United States skirted on the edges of bankruptcy in 1895 when our government gold stock shrank ominously and was bailed out by a last minute gold loan, underwritten by a Wall Street syndicate.\n\nThere is little doubt that under the gold standard the restraint on both public and private credit creation limited price inflation, but it was also increasingly perceived as too restrictive to government discretion. The abandonment of the domestic convertibility of gold effectively augmented the power of the monetary authorities to create claims. Possibly as a consequence, post-World War II fluctuations in gross domestic product have been somewhat less than those prior to the 1930s, and no major economic contraction of the dimensions experienced in earlier years has occurred in major industrial countries. On the other hand, peace-time inflation has been far more virulent.\n\nToday, the widespread presumption is that, as a consequence of expectations of continuing inflation over the longer run, both nominal and real long-term interest rates are currently higher than they would otherwise be. Arguably, at root is the potential, however remote, of unconstrained issuance of claims unsupported by the production of goods and services and the accumulation of real assets.\n\nPressures for increased credit unrelated to the needs of markets emerge not only as a consequence of new government debt obligations, both direct and contingent, but also because of government regulations that induce private sector expenditure and borrowing. All of these government-derived demands on resources must be satisfied. Hence, when those demands increase, interest rates tend to rise to crowd out other types of spending.\n\nAny employment of the sovereign credit rating for the issuance of government debt, the guaranteeing of the liabilities of depository institutions, or the liquification of assets of depository institutions enables the preemption of real private resources by government fiat. Increased availability of a central bank credit facility, even if not drawn upon, can induce increased credit extension by banks and increased activity by their customers, since creditors of banks are more willing to finance banks' activities with such a governmental backstop available. If that takes place in an environment of strained resource availability, expanded subsidies to depository institutions --which are often referred to as the \"safety net' --can only augment the pressures. An accommodative monetary policy can ease the strain, but only temporarily and only at the risk of inflation at a later date unless interest rates are eventually allowed to rise. This dilemma is most historically evident in its extreme form during times of war, when governments must choose whether to finance part of the increased war outlays\n\nthrough increased central bank credit or depend wholly on taxes and borrowing from private sources.\n\nAccordingly central banks, and finance ministries, must remain especially vigilant in maintaining a proper balance between a safety net that fosters economic and financial stabilization and one that does not. It is in this context of competing demands for resources and the government's unique position that we should consider the role of the central bank in interfacing with banks, and in some instances with other private financial institutions, as lenders of last resort, supervisors, and providers of financial services.\n\n## Relationship to banks and bank supervision\n\nIt is important to remember that many of the benefits banks provide modern societies derive from their willingness to take risks and from their use of a relatively high degree of financial leverage. Through leverage, in the form principally of taking deposits, banks perform a critical role in the financial intermediation process; they provide savers with additional investment choices and borrowers with a greater range of sources of credit, thereby facilitating a more efficient allocation of resources and contributing importantly to greater economic growth. Indeed, it has been the evident value of intermediation and leverage that has shaped the development of our financial systems from the earliest times --certainly since Renaissance goldsmiths discovered that lending out deposited gold was feasible and profitable.\n\nCentral bank provision of a mechanism for converting highly illiquid portfolios into liquid ones in extraordinary circumstances has led to a greater degree of leverage in banking than market forces alone would support. Traditionally this has been accomplished by making discount or Lombard facilities available, so that individual depositories could turn illiquid assets into liquid resources and not exacerbate unsettled market conditions by the forced selling of such assets or the calling of loans. More broadly, open market operations, in situations like that which followed the crash of stock markets around the world in 1987, satisfy increased needs for liquidity for the system as a whole that otherwise could feed cumulative, self-reinforcing, contractions across many financial markets.\n\nOf course, this same leverage and risk-taking also greatly increase the possibility of bank failures. Without leverage, losses from risk-taking would be absorbed by a bank's owners, virtually eliminating the chance that the bank would be unable to meet its obligations in the case of a \"failure.\" Some failures can be of a bank's own making, resulting, for example, from poor credit judgments. For the most part, these failures are a normal and important part of the market process and provide discipline and information to other participants regarding the level of business risks. However, because of the important roles that banks and other financial intermediaries play in our financial systems, such failures could have large ripple effects that spread throughout business and financial markets at great cost.\n\nAny use of sovereign credit --even its potential use --creates moral hazard, that is, a distortion of incentives that occurs when the party that determines the level of risk receives the gains from, but does not bear the full costs of, the risks taken. At the extreme, monetary authorities could guarantee all private liabilities, which might assuage any immediate crisis but leave a long-term legacy of distorted incentives and presumably thwarted growth potential. Thus, governments, including central banks, have to strive for a balanced use of the sovereign credit rating. It is a difficult tradeoff, but we are seeking a balance in which we can ensure the desired degree of intermediation even in times of financial stress without engendering an unacceptable degree of moral hazard.\n\nThe disconnect between risk-taking by banks and banks' cost of capital, which has been reduced by the presence of the safety net, has made necessary a degree of supervision and regulation that would not be necessary without the existence of the safety net. That is, regulators are compelled to act as a surrogate for market discipline since the market signals that usually accompany excessive risk-taking are substantially muted, and because the prices to banks of government deposit guarantees, or of access to the safety net more generally, do not, and probably cannot, vary sufficiently with risk to mimic market prices. The problems that arise from the retarding of the pressures of market discipline have led us increasingly to understand that the ideal strategy for supervision and regulation is to endeavor to simulate the market responses that would occur if there were no safety net, but without giving up the basic requirement that financial market disruptions be minimized.\n\nTo be sure, we should recognize that if we choose to have the advantages of a leveraged system of financial intermediaries, the burden of managing risk in the financial system will not lie with the private sector alone. With leveraging there will always exist a remote possibility of a chain reaction, a cascading sequence of defaults that will culminate in financial implosion if it proceeds unchecked. Only a central bank, with its unlimited power to create money, can with a high probability thwart such a process before it becomes destructive. Hence, central banks will of necessity be drawn into becoming lenders of last resort. But implicit in the existence of such a role is that there will be some sort of allocation between the public and private sectors of the burden of risk of extreme outcomes. Thus, central banks are led to provide what essentially amounts to catastrophic financial insurance coverage. Such a public subsidy should be reserved for only the rarest of disasters. If the owners or managers of private financial institutions were to anticipate being propped up frequently by government support, it would only encourage reckless and irresponsible practices.\n\nIn theory, the allocation of responsibility for risk-bearing between the private sector and the central bank depends upon an evaluation of the private cost of capital. In order to attract, or at least retain, capital, a private financial institution must earn at minimum the overall economy's rate of return, adjusted for risk. In competitive financial markets, the greater the leverage, the higher the rate of return, before adjustment for risk. If private financial institutions have to absorb all financial risk, then the degree to which they can leverage will be limited, the financial sector smaller, and its contribution to the economy more limited. On the other hand, if central banks effectively insulate private institutions from the largest potential losses, however incurred, increased laxity could threaten a major drain on taxpayers or produce inflationary instability as a consequence of excess money creation.\n\nIn practice, the policy choice of how much, if any, of the extreme market risk that government authorities should absorb is fraught with many complexities. Yet we central bankers make this decision every day, either explicitly or by default. Moreover, we can never know for sure whether the decisions we made were appropriate. The question is not whether our actions are seen to have been necessary in retrospect; the absence of a fire does not mean that we should not have paid for fire insurance. Rather, the question is whether, ex ante, the probability of a systemic collapse was sufficient to warrant intervention. Often, we cannot wait to see whether, in hindsight, the problem will be judged to have been an isolated event and largely benign.\n\nThus, governments, including central banks, have been given certain responsibilities related to their banking and financial systems that must be balanced. We have the responsibility to prevent major financial market disruptions through development and enforcement of prudent regulatory standards and, if necessary in rare circumstances, through\n\ndirect intervention in market events. But we also have the responsibility to ensure that private sector institutions have the capacity to take prudent and appropriate risks, even though such risks will sometimes result in unanticipated bank losses or even bank failures.\n\nOur goal as supervisors, therefore, should not be to prevent all bank failures, but to maintain sufficient prudential standards so that banking problems that do occur do not become widespread. We try to achieve the proper balance through official regulations, as well as through formal and informal supervisory policies and procedures.\n\nTo some extent, we do this over time by signalling to the market, through our actions, the kinds of circumstances in which we might be willing to intervene to quell financial turmoil, and conversely, what levels of difficulties we expect private institutions to resolve by themselves. The market, then, responds by adjusting the cost of capital to banks.\n\nThroughout most of this century, we central bankers have made our decisions largely in a domestic context. However, in recent decades that situation has changed markedly for many countries and, obviously, is changing rapidly here in Europe.\n\nWhile failures will inevitably occur in a dynamic market, the safety net --not to mention concerns over systemic risk --requires that regulators not be indifferent to how banks manage their risks. To avoid having to resort to numbing micromanagement, regulators have increasingly insisted that banks put in place systems that allow management to have both the information and procedures to be aware of their own true risk exposures on a global basis and to be able to modify such exposures. The better these risk information and control systems, the more risk a bank can prudently assume.\n\nThe revolution in information and data processing technology has transformed our financial markets and the way our financial institutions conduct their operations. In most respects, these technological advances have enhanced the potential for reducing transactions costs, to the benefit of consumers of financial services, and for managing risks. But in some respects they have increased the potential for more rapid and widespread disruption.\n\nThe efficiency of global financial markets, engendered by the rapid proliferation of financial products, has the capability of transmitting mistakes at a far faster pace throughout the financial system in ways that were unknown a generation ago, and not even remotely imagined in the 19th century. Financial crises in the early 19th century, for example, particularly those associated with the Napoleonic Wars, were often related to military and other events in faraway places. Communication was still comparatively primitive. An investor's speculative position could be wiped out by a military setback, and he might not even know about it for days or even weeks.\n\nSimilarly, the collapse of Barings Brothers in 1995 showed how much more rapidly losses can be generated in the current environment relative to a century earlier when Barings Brothers confronted a similar episode. Current technology enables single individuals to initiate massive transactions with very rapid execution. Clearly, not only has the productivity of global finance increased markedly, but so, obviously, has the ability to generate losses at a previously inconceivable rate.\n\nWhether we think about risk in financial markets from a national or, increasingly, international perspective, we should recognize that, if it is technology that has imparted occasional stress to markets, technology can be employed to contain it. Enhancements\n\nto financial institutions' internal risk-management systems arguably constitute one of the most effective countermeasures to the increased potential instability of the global financial system.\n\nBecause the evolution of new technologies takes time, I suspect that we have tended to exaggerate the negative effects of information and data processing technologies on financial markets. We have focussed on the ability of financial market participants to increase their leverage beyond the elusive optimum point. That is, some have voiced concern that the subsidy embodied in the safety net has supported a greater degree of risk-taking than might be appropriate. This is obviously a legitimate concern.\n\nNonetheless, although we may not yet fully appreciate the benefits of recent technological advances, the availability of new technology and new derivative financial instruments already has facilitated more rigorous approaches to the conceptualization, measurement, and management of risk by financial institutions. There are, of course, limitations to the statistical models used in such systems owing to the necessity of overly simplifying assumptions. Consequently, human judgments, based on analytically less precise but far more realistic evaluations of what the future may hold, are of critical importance in risk management. Although a sophisticated understanding of statistical modeling techniques is important to risk management, an intimate knowledge of the markets in which an institution trades, and of the customers it serves, is turning out to be far more important.\n\nThe diminishing of legal, institutional, and now technological barriers to international financial activities has provided strong impetus to the process of cooperation I referred to earlier. The efforts of bank supervisors meeting at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel have been especially prominent, and deservedly so. They have set minimum standards for sound banking for the world's major banks and have sensitized all of us to the risks that banks must manage. However, their work is not done. Our concepts of appropriate standards continue to evolve just as the technology of risk management evolves. In addition, supervisors from the G-10 countries must continue their efforts to bring supervisors from other countries, including the emerging and transition economies of Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe into the process of cooperation --both to learn from their experiences and to encourage other countries to strengthen their own supervisory systems.\n\n## Financial services\n\nWhile I do not intend to say much about the provision of financial services by central banks, I might distinguish --in an oversimplified fashion --two types of functions. One includes issuing currency, acting as fiscal agent for the government, and other functions that are reasonably straightforward and primarily, though not exclusively, domestic in character. I say straightforward, although I recognize that central bankers in Europe are devoting an extraordinary amount of effort to making sure that such functions will be performed well even as the monetary side of the European Union evolves. These are crucial functions that central banks naturally perform. Nevertheless, one should consider from time to time the extent to which the private sector could perform some of these functions more effectively.\n\nThe other type of function relates more closely to the principal thrust of my remarks today and involves the need to ensure that the global financial system operates smoothly. What I have in mind specifically is a central bank's role in large value or interbank payment systems: on the one hand, setting standards for risk controls and monitoring the systems; on the other hand, providing certainty, or \"finality,\" to payments made among\n\nparticipants in the system and, when necessary and appropriate, providing liquidity to participants. Any private bank, or for that matter any private business organization, can provide payment services with final settlement. The difficulty is that the final claim on the books of any private institution is not risk-free. Only a central bank is in a position to perform these functions under all circumstances. That, of course, is an element of the safety net, and it therefore raises the same issues of moral hazard and potential abuse of a nation's sovereign credit rating.\n\nTo be sure, private financial institutions themselves must work to develop the infrastructure for ensuring that payments and settlements can take place with reasonable confidence and that the risks other than those absorbed by the central bank are well understood and properly managed. Those risks will not be eliminated entirely; reducing \"float\" in the payment system to zero, which would eliminate settlement risk, must be balanced by the capital costs of doing so. It has been just in the last year or so that the risks associated with settlement of the enormous volume of foreign exchange transactions have been fully appreciated, more than 20 years after an incident involving Bank Herstatt in Germany brought this issue to international attention. A report produced last year by a G-10 central bank committee elaborated on these risks and urged the private sector to respond with appropriate institutions and risk controls. I am encouraged that much progress seems to be underway in this area, as in others.\n\n## Monetary policy\n\nThis brings me, finally, to the area of monetary policy --the fundamental responsibility of a modern central bank. In this area, I am pleased to say, there have been positive developments, especially with regard to inflation. The recent record on inflation reduction in industrial countries has been impressive. Measured consumer price inflation in G10 countries averaged only about 2-1/4 percent last year, down more than 3 percentage points from what it was in 1990. Consumer price increases on average in the G-10 have been kept under 3 percent for the past five years --the longest such period of sustained low inflation in more than three decades. Inflation performance in developing countries also has improved substantially. This success reflects in large part a thorough conceptual overhaul of economic thinking and policymaking. A consensus gradually emerged starting in the late 1970s that inflation destroyed jobs, or at least could not create them. This view has become particularly evident in the communiques that have emanated from the high-level international gatherings of the past two decades.\n\nWe should take care, however, that our recent success not make us complacent. It is becoming increasingly evident that a key ingredient in achieving the highest possible levels of productivity, real incomes, and living standards over the long run is maintenance of price stability. But to sustain good inflation performance, we need to understand the other factors that lie behind our recent success, in addition to the policy consensus of governments, which must not be allowed to ebb as memories of the stagflation in the 1970s fade. Internally, various steps are being implemented that free up markets and intensify competition, not just in product markets, but in labor markets and financial sectors as well. On the external side, emerging nations, especially in Asia and Latin America, have become increasingly important as production sites and markets and thus as competitors. Faced with this broadened foreign competition, firms in many countries now find it less easy than in the past to raise prices during periods of rising demand at home.\n\nThe process of adjustment has not been entirely painless. Industrial economies in particular are going through an extended period of economic and financial restructuring that has hit some sectors, firms, and groups of workers particularly hard. The fact that in the past these groups may have felt insulated from such forces probably heightened the consequent stress, and may have contributed to some general uncertainty and insecurity. As a result, workers at present, to a greater extent than usual, trade aspirations for higher levels of earnings for job security.\n\nClearly it takes some time for an economy to realize the full benefits of transition from a highor even moderate-inflation environment --with associated uncertainties about future inflation --to one where inflation is low and under control. Inflation expectations throughout the economy must fall, and financial-market premia related to inflation uncertainty have to dissipate.\n\nI doubt the tasks of central bankers will become any easier as we move into the 21st century. Clearly price stability should and will remain the central goal of our activities. But we are having increasing difficulty in pinning down the notion of what constitutes a stable price level. When industrial product was the centerpiece of the advanced economies during the first two-thirds of this century, our overall price indexes served us well. Pricing a pound of electrolytic copper presented few definitional problems. The price of a ton of cold rolled steel sheet, or a linear yard of cotton broad woven fabric, could be reasonably compared over a period of years.\n\nBut as the century draws to a close, the simple notion of price has turned decidedly ambiguous. What is the price of a unit of software or a legal opinion? How does one evaluate the change in the price of a cataract operation over a ten-year period when the nature of the procedure and its impact on the patient has changed so radically. Indeed, how will we measure inflation, and the associated financial and real implications, in the 21st century when our data --using current techniques --could become increasingly less adequate to trace price trends over time?\n\nSo long as individuals make contractual arrangements for future payments valued in dollars, or marks, or francs, there must be a presumption on the part of those involved in the transaction about the future purchasing power of money. No matter how complex individual products become, there will always be some general sense of the purchasing power of money both across time and across goods and services. Hence, we must assume that embodied in all products is some unit of output and hence of price that is recognizable to producers and consumers and upon which they will base their decisions. Doubtless, we will develop new techniques of price measurement to unearth them as the years go on. It is crucial that we do, for inflation can destabilize an economy even if faulty price indexes fail to reveal it.\n\nHowever such conceptual and technical issues are resolved, central bankers need to err on the side of caution. Working in the context of our individual political environments, we are the ultimate protectors and preservers of the value of our currencies. A central banker cannot be exempted from one very basic fact: In the long run inflation is essentially a monetary phenomenon. Accordingly, the best approach is to maintain a steady course with an appropriate level of restraint. Countries whose currencies are widely used internationally, like the United States, have a special responsibility to provide an anchor of stability for themselves and the world at large.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, let me bring together three aspects of central bank responsibilities. Monetary policy must aim to provide a stable macroeconomic environment, to promote sustainable long-term economic growth without inflation and to allow financial markets to operate without excessive uncertainty. Central banks provide direct support to financial markets through their role in the safety net, that is, the extension to the financial system, under certain circumstances, of the nation's sovereign credit rating. This element of subsidy requires a degree of supervision and regulation to ensure that the safety net is not abused. The payment system, and the central banks' involvement in it, is a key element of the safety net and is, as well, at the core of the financial system through which monetary policy is implemented.\n\nCentral banks, like everyone else, operate in a global financial market. I can say with some confidence that everywhere, not just in Europe, the concept of a domestic market will have even less meaning in a decade than it does today. It is much more difficult to predict what the world will look like in all its dimensions, but my hope and expectation is that central banks will play a positive part. As all industrial countries are likely to experience similar forces, cooperation is key to our continued success.\n\nBIS Review 3/1997",

I am delighted to have the opportunity to address you all this afternoon.\n\n- 2  When Mark Burton suggested that I might look back at developments in the commercial property market during the eight years that I have been doing my present job, that appealed to me because I shall be retiring from the Bank next month. But I also like to look to the future and to identify coming issues and challenges. With that in mind, I will also pick out some of the factors relevant to the industry as it moves forward.\n\n## The Past\n\n- 3    My  involvement  with  commercial  property  began  in  1985,  when  plans  for Canary  Wharf  were  beginning  to  materialise.  One  of  the  questions  put  to  the  Bank  by  the developers was whether we would change our  policy  encouraging  banks  to  have  their  offices close to the Bank. We recognised that our policy was distorting the market and we decided to make the change. I have followed the property story ever since. But, for today's purposes, I shall take  as  my  starting  point  a  speech  given  by  the  previous  Governor  to  the  RICS  in  Paris  in October  1989.  You  will  recall  that  everything  in  the  garden  then  seemed  rosy.  Cranes  were everywhere on  the  horizon;  there  was  an  expectation  that  rents  and  capital  values  could  only move upwards. Banks were developing innovative financing techniques and competing fiercely with one another to finance all this activity. Income returns were not out of the ordinary but the market was underpinned by the prospect of capital gain.\n- 4    Yet  some  participants  and  commentators  were  beginning  to  have  concerns about  the  scale  of  development.  The  Governor  questioned  whether  there  would  be  sufficient demand for the supply coming on stream. He noted too the banks' rapidly growing exposure to the sector. The sector was quite simply heading for overcapacity and overgearing. Why did the lenders  not  see  it  coming?  Perhaps  inability  or  unwillingness  to  see  the  big  picture  was  one reason - but more of that later. We have been asked quite often why we  as  the  supervisor  of banks  did  not  stop  them  overlending.  The  answer  remains  the  same.  The  banks  have  to  be responsible  for  their  own  commercial  decisions.  We  are  there  to  protect  their  depositors,  not their shareholders. But we can usefully draw their attention to gathering clouds - and that is what we did.\n- 5  As we all know, the required level of demand did not materialise. The resultant oversupply  of  space  contributed  to  one  of  the  most  severe  downturns  that  the  commercial property industry has ever seen. Since then, other asset classes have outperformed commercial property  in  most  years.  Many  institutional  investors  have  responded  by  continuing  to  reduce their  property  holdings.  Property  companies  have  suffered;  we  have  seen  some  high  profile failures  and  reschedulings.  The  banks  have  suffered  very  sizeable  losses  on  commercial property.  Construction  companies  and  associated  professions  such  as  architects  and  designers have suffered from the reduced workload on commercial property. And we must not forget the\n\nvaluing and surveying professions; the upturn in insolvency-related work was not sufficient to offset lower turnover and the corresponding heavy pressure on fees.\n\n- 6    Possibly  the  only  ones  to  benefit  from  the  downturn  were  tenants  fortunate enough to sign new leases in an environment of falling rents. The modest extent of subsequent development has probably meant that even these 'beneficiaries' have had a more limited choice of accommodation.\n- 7    Other  factors  have  also  made  the  market  very  challenging,  especially  for investors  and  lenders.  These  have  included  the  speed  of  building  obsolescence  and  growing pressure on companies to manage property resources more effectively. Several initiatives aimed at enhancing the market's efficiency and attractiveness made little headway in the first half of the 1990s. These included efforts to enhance liquidity, to develop property derivatives, and to improve  information  on  the  very  sizeable  part  of  the  market  that  is  not  'prime'.  In  addition, efforts  to  enhance  transparency  have  not  progressed  as  well  as  I  myself  and  many  market participants had hoped.\n- 8    There  have of course been some  positive developments,  such as the development  by  BZW  of  Property  Investment  Certificates,  the  growing  importance  of  data produced by the Investment Property Databank, and the development by RICS of new valuation standards  in  the  revised  Red  Book.  Some  of  the  trade  associations,  such  as  the  IPF  and  the Association  of  Property  Bankers,  have  also  developed  well  and  have  begun  to  play  a  very important role. I believe the Bank of England's Property Forum, set up in 1993 to bring all sides of the industry together, has also made a positive contribution. But these developments cannot obscure the fact that, on the whole, this period has been one of disappointment. Property's poor performance  in  the  past  few  years  has  undoubtedly  caused  some  to  consider  very  carefully whether or not they wish to remain in property.\n\n## The Present\n\n- 9  Are we turning a corner? The commercial property market is important to the UK  economy  in  many  ways.  Property  and  related  activities  such  as  construction  make  a significant contribution to GDP. The availability of property of the right standards at the right price  is  very  important  to  UK  competitiveness.  This  puts  some  onus  on  landlords  to  provide what is wanted. It is equally important that the planning authorities should continue to provide a consistent and flexible planning framework in which developers and landlords can operate and earn  a  satisfactory  return.  It  is  pleasing  that  the  market  is  at  last  beginning  to  show  signs  of strengthening. Indeed there is some evidence of incipient overheating.\n- 10  Many institutional investors are taking the view that commercial property will be one of the better performing asset classes over the next couple of years and there is significant buying  activity  both  from  UK  and  overseas.  There  are  increasing  signs  of  development, involving both institutional investors and, on quite a large scale, property companies. And the banks too have been showing strong interest in the sector, with many new entrants joining the large number of more established participants.\n\n11  Finally, there are encouraging signs of progress on several initiatives. The IPF has made its case to the Treasury for a change in the tax status of securitised vehicles, and others are  looking  to  develop  existing  routes.  Many  investors  are telling us that  progress  on securitisation will be crucial if they are to remain in property at all, so the better tone is not a valid excuse to give up on structural improvements to the market. There is welcome progress on\n\nthe  derivatives  front,  through  BZW's  Property  Index  Forward  instrument  and  the  REIM initiative. Some  participants are showing interest in improving the quality of market information. The  Incorporated  Society  of  Valuers  and  the  RICS  are  funding  research  by  IPD into the performance of the secondary market and, although this project is still in its infancy, I hope very much that you will support these efforts as the project develops. Indeed, on the basis that transparency generally improves the performance of markets, I would, personally, support John  Ritblat's  opinion  that  commercial  transaction  prices  should  be  made  public  through  the land register. Some of you would lose proprietorial advantage as a result in the short term, but in the long run a more liquid market benefits the most professional more than the free riders.\n\n12  It would, however, be rash to conclude that the market is now unambiguously healthy in all respects. There are still several factors which will continue to pose challenges to the investment, banking and valuing communities. For example, while lease lengths may have temporarily stabilised,  break  clauses  exercisable  by  tenants  are  becoming  more  common.  And despite the positive tone of the recent CBI/Grimley survey, it is clear too that many occupiers will  continue  over  the  long-term  to  reduce  their  needs  for  space  and  to  demand  greater flexibility. Privity of contract has disappeared on new leases. All of these factors are making it less straightforward to form a view of the quality of cashflow likely to stem from a particular building.\n\n13  There is a sizeable overhang of unlet secondary property. The pool of such property increases every time that a major user of space moves into new offices and releases its former premises. While some of the better quality secondary property can be refurbished at an economic price and relet, much of this stock may never again be relet for its present use and may not lend itself readily to conversion for alternative uses. This will continue to exert a dampening influence on the market, and imaginative solutions will be needed.\n\n## The Future\n\n14  So, the market may be improving but it is still not easy. How is the market likely to develop over the next eight years? What will I be saying if you invite me back in the year 2005?\n\n15  As we all know, the property market has, historically, moved in cycles. Some, notably  RICS,  have  done  work  to  develop  our  understanding  of  these  cycles.  The  economic cycle itself is clearly one of the driving factors, though it is clear too that property is subject to its own fluctuations and its own step changes. Contributing factors include the strength of tenant demand, the activities of developers and  the  willingness  of  lenders  to  finance  investment  and development.\n\n16  My story in the future could be similar - perhaps depressingly similar - to my review  of  the  recent  past.  Many  of  the  'ingredients'  that  contributed  to  the  last  cycle  are certainly present now. Institutional investors are attracted to the sector in the short-term but they could easily resume their longer-term departure from property in a couple of years. This could happen if property's performance runs out of steam as the economic cycle progresses and other asset  classes  begin  to  look  more  attractive.  It  is  conceivable  that  the  banks  might  become disillusioned with property again, particularly if  they  relax  their  lending  criteria  too  far  in  the current exceptionally competitive lending market. This could also happen if they are seduced by the  outlook  for  the  better  properties  into  taking  excessive  risks  on  the  secondary  and  tertiary sectors, for which the outlook generally appears rather less bright. We are in favour of healthy competition among lenders but history suggests  that  the  seeds  of  tomorrow's  losses  are  sown\n\nwhen lenders relax the basics such as loan to value ratios and income cover; or when they take very bullish views on the likely strength of cashflows. We hear that some lenders are seeking to pressurise  valuers  into  higher  valuations.  This  is  not  a  healthy  practise  and  we  hope  both  the lenders and the valuing profession will be strong enough to resist and will stick to the principles of the new Red Book.\n\n17  There are undoubtedly differences between 1989 and this stage of the present cycle,  perhaps  the  most  notable  of  which  are  the  comparatively  limited  scale  of  speculative development and more realistic expectations. And notwithstanding my rather jaundiced remarks above about forgotten lessons, some of the risks involved in commercial property are now better understood. This could simply mean that this cycle will repeat history but in a less pronounced way than last time. Perhaps I should at this point recognise the VAT changes announced in the last budget. These have caused a strong reaction from the property industry. They have caused a halt to  a  number  of  major  deals.  I  do  not  know  how  the  matter  will  be  resolved  and  will  not speculate whether the impact will be lasting. More of that no doubt in coming weeks. But are there any other new influences which could bring about a different - and better - outcome than the  last  cycle?  There  are  at  least  four  other  important  factors  which  arguably  did  not  exist  in 1989. They may all make the market less volatile in the years ahead. Let me be a bit visionary.\n\n18  The first of these is a low inflationary environment. The political constituency for low inflation is now almost certainly stronger than at any time in living memory. There is a real prospect that a low inflation environment can be sustained into the future. This is a profound change and should help to smooth the path of future economic cycles. This environment is likely to mean slower growth in nominal rents and also less volatile capital values. The emphasis will continue to change from capital gain to running yield. Poor investment or loan decisions will not be  forgiven  by  inflation.  This  environment  will  alter  attitudes  to  property,  especially  among users  who  will  increasingly  regard  it  purely  as  a  factor  of  production  subject  to  the  full disciplines of cost controls. But lower nominal rents need not mean lower real income.\n\n19    The  second  fundamental  difference  lies  in  the  role,  and  potential,  of  the Private Finance Initiative. In many ways, the PFI simply reflects processes already underway in the private sector whereby occupiers are seeking more flexible arrangements and are prepared to pay a price for changing the traditional relationship between landlord and tenant. It opens up the possibilities  for  more  imaginative  use  of  property,  and  the  principles  are  applicable  both  to public and private sector users of property. The providers of services, whether public sector or private, no longer want automatically to own the productive assets needed to provide them. They prefer  to  rent  them  instead  with  a  higher  level  of  service  as  part  of  the  deal.  Landlords  with property expertise are well placed to provide this wider type of service and have a competitive advantage  in  doing  so  compared  with  less  experienced  operators.  And  maybe  the  word 'property' will itself imply something too narrow. Owners will provide a working environment. They may move from 'core and shell' to 'finish and facilitate'. Indeed in some PFI cases the owners  will  go  even  further  and  operate  as  well,  'provide  and  process'  you  might  say.  This would give outsourcing a new meaning. Perhaps  from  your  point  of  view  it  should  be  called insourcing. If risks are properly identified and priced, the PFI potentially can provide the longerterm bond-type investments that many of you are seeking. It offers great opportunities to all of you. This revolution has only just begun.\n\n20 A third issue that is particularly relevant now is technology. It has undoubtedly contributed  to  property  obsolescence.  But  technology  is  potentially  an  important  ally,  and  in more senses than one. Developments in building and construction techniques, as well as smaller and more powerful machinery and computer technology, facilitate the construction of buildings\n\nthat  meet  occupiers'  needs.  Information  technology  enhances  the  usability  and  efficiency  of property as an asset class. Just  as  Mr.  Otis  made  skyscrapers  possible,  one  of  you  will  create completely new configurations of site exploitation - or develop new and integrated relationships between  different  buildings.  The  automobile  and  advertising  have  entirely  altered  the  shape, size,  appearance  and  location  of  shops  in  the  USA  -  and  to  a  lesser  extent  here.  But  today's offices still look pretty much to me like those designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Is there scope for  an  IT  driven  revolution  in  the  next  eight  years  in  which  the  working  environment  is transformed into a virtual reality? I do not know but I am convinced we ain't seen nothing yet.\n\n- 21    The  fourth  factor  could  make  an  important  difference  -  greater  market liquidity  and  instruments  such  as  derivatives  which  will  facilitate  short-term  tactical  positiontaking or investment. The enthusiasm and momentum for them is apparent both from what the market  tells  us  and  from  recent  surveys.  A  clear  message  from  our  wide  range  of  property contacts is that greater liquidity is essential if commercial property is to remain attractive as an asset class. There is equally a  clear  message  that  successful  development  of  securitisation  and derivatives will not on its own be the saviour of commercial property. But without it property will not turn in a performance which can stand comparison with competing assets. We need a mature,  liquid  cash  market  in  property  with  a  healthy  derivative  market  to  permit  successful management of risk. These are essential characteristics of efficient markets which are necessary for  efficient  use  of  property  by  users  as  a  factor  of  production.  Without  such  a  development there is a risk that the costs of doing business in the UK will be uncompetitively high. I do not know how, or indeed whether, the obstacles to the development of such markets can be easily found. But I regard these issues as nationally important.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- 22  So, what is likely to happen in the next eight years? Let me sum up my vision.\n- 23    The  current  strong  commitment  to  keeping  inflation  in  check  will  create conditions  more  conducive  to  rational  long-term  decisions.  Commercial  property  is  still  to  a large  extent  a  longer-term  asset  and  should  benefit  from  this  environment.  The  market  will require property investors and owners to recognise and adapt to changing requirements from the users,  particularly  their  increasing  wish  to  manage  the  risks  of  property  occupation  more efficiently. It will require  a  willingness  to  work  in  partnership  with  tenants  and  to  exploit  the benefits  of  technology  to  the  full.  Lenders  and  other  property  professionals  will  need  to understand and embrace these changes. I know that some of you already recognise this. Some of you are not afraid of the PFI. We have recently had the end of history, the end of politics. Will the end of distance be next? Will 'location, location, location' be replaced by 'communications, communications, communications'?\n- 24  This environment offers opportunities which you may - or may not - wish to take. Those who take these opportunities will be the survivors and thrivers. I leave you with my old  refrain  ringing  in  your  ears:  transparency;  liquidity;  intelligent  investment;  revenue  not capital gain; innovation - all the qualities of a deep, high quality market place.",

         "Mr. Meyer reviews the economic outlook and challenges for monetary policy in\\_the United States Remarks by Mr. Laurence H. Meyer, a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Charlotte Economics Club, Charlotte, North Carolina on 16/1/97.\n\n1996 was an extraordinarily good year for the economy. Measured on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis, it appears that GDP advanced around 3% and prices, measured by the chain price index for GDP, increased just above 2%.\n\nA little historical perspective will help us further appreciate recent economic performance. Inflation in 1996, measured by the chain price index for GDP or the core CPI, was the lowest in 30 years. And this was not a one-year fluke. Last year was the fifth consecutive year that inflation, measured by the chain GDP price index, was 2.6% or lower and the 5-year compound annual inflation rate is now 2.5%, the lowest since 1967.\n\nThe extraordinary achievement of 1996, of course, was reaching such low levels of unemployment and inflation at the same time. The 5.4% unemployment rate in 1996 was the lowest annual rate since 1988 and before that since 1973. Specifically, the surprise was a decline in measures of core inflation for consumer and producer goods and in the inflation rate for the GDP price index during a year when the unemployment rate declined and averaged more than Y percentage point below levels that in the past had been associated with stable inflation.\n\nIn the second half of the year, growth slowed, the unemployment rate stabilized, and inflation remained well contained. There is little evidence of imbalances that would jeopardize the expansion. As a result, the consensus forecast projects growth near trend and relatively stable inflation and unemployment rates.\n\nWe should not, however, let ourselves be overcome by our good fortune. The business cycle is not dead and monetary policy is certain to be challenged again. At the moment, trend growth near full employment appears to be a reasonable prospect in the year ahead. Still we want to remain alert for challenges that might lie just over the horizon. In particular, there remains some uncertainty as to whether the current unemployment rate will prove consistent with stable inflation over time and we need to pay some attention to the challenge of how we approach our longer-term goal of achieving and maintaining price stability.\n\nFirst I will discuss the risks in the outlook. Next I will consider some explanations for the surprisingly good recent inflation performance and implications for inflation going forward. I'll end with a discussion of challenges for the Federal Reserve: three it has faced and met in this expansion, one still in play, and one that may deserve further attention.\n\n## Balanced Risks Going Forward\n\nWhen I arrived at the Board in late June of last year, the risks appeared to be one-sided. The economy was near capacity and growing above trend. There was a clear risk of overheating, and monetary policy was poised to tighten if necessary. But the forecast was that growth would slow toward trend and, given how well behaved inflation remained, we believed we could afford to be patient and give economic growth a chance to moderate and, so far at least, that patience appears to have been justified.\n\nDuring the second half of 1996, the risks in the outlook became more balanced. The most recent data suggest stronger growth in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter, but growth in the second half of 1996 seems to have been slower than in the first half of the year, and the recent data have not altered my expectation that the economy will grow near trend over the next year.\n\nWhat factors might disturb this benign picture? I want to focus on two basic risks in the outlook — what I will refer to as utilization risk and the growth risk. Let's start with the utilization risk. There is a risk that the current unemployment rate is already below its critical threshold, the full employment unemployment rate, also known as the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or NAIRU. In this case, trend growth would sustain the prevailing unemployment rate and would therefore be accompanied by modest upward pressure on the inflation rate. Compensation per hour has been edging upward, consistent with the unemployment rate being slightly below NAIRU; on the other hand, core measures of inflation have been trending lower, with the opposite implication. This contrast has kept the Federal Reserve alert, but on the sidelines. But it would be unwise to ignore this risk factor.\n\nThe growth risk is the risk that growth will be above or below trend. Higher trend growth is unquestionably desirable and should, of course, be accommodated by monetary policy. But above-trend growth implies rising utilization rates. Given that the economy is already near capacity, such an increase in utilization rates would raise the risk of higher inflation.\n\nWhen you are near full employment with stable inflation and growing at trend, both higher and lower growth become risk factors. Another way of making this point is that the downside of such excellent economic performance is that virtually any alternative scenario will represent a deterioration. It's like being at the top of a mountain. There is an exhilaration from getting there and the view is great, but all paths are downhill.\n\nStill, history suggests that expansions do not usually end because aggregate demand spontaneously weakens, but rather as a result of excessively buoyant demand, resulting in an overheated economy and an associated acceleration of inflation. On balance, taking into account the possibility that we are already slightly below NAIRU and historical precedent, I have slightly greater concern that inflation will increase than that the economy will lapse into persistent below trend growth and face rising unemployment and further disinflation. This modest asymmetry relative to the base forecast suggests that we need to balance our celebration over recent economic performance with a vigilance with respect to future developments to ensure that the progress we have made with respect to inflation over the last fifteen years is not eroded.\n\n## The Inflation -Unemployment Rate Puzzle\n\nThe recent surprisingly good inflation performance challenges our understanding of inflation dynamics. The equation relied on in most structural macro models to explain inflation, the Phillips Curve, has recently been over-predicting inflation. Some will no doubt argue that there should be no great surprise here because the Phillips Curve regularity between short-run movements in inflation and unemployment was long ago theoretically discredited and historically repudiated. When I hear such remarks, and I often do, I know I am listening to someone who has not bothered to look at the data and probably has never estimated a Phillips Curve nor tried his or her hand at forecasting inflation. The truth is that the Philips Curve, in its modern, expectations-augmented form, was the single most stable and useful econometric tool in a forecaster's arsenal for most of the last fifteen years.\n\nDuring this period at Laurence H. Meyer &amp; Associates, our excellent inflation forecasting record was based on one simple rule: don't try to outguess our Phillips Curve. We did not always, of course, religiously follow our own rule. I remember vividly one episode when inflation accelerated early in the year and I convinced my partners to adjust our inflation forecast upward by add-factoring our Phillips Curve. One of our clients called to brag that he was going to make a better inflation forecast for the year than we were. His secret: he was going to ignore our judgment and listen to our model instead. He suggested we do likewise. He was right. Our equation once again distinguished itself.\n\nOver the last couple of years, however, estimated Phillips Curves have generally been subject to systematic over-prediction errors; that is, the inflation rate is lower than would have been expected based on the historical relationship and given the prevailing unemployment rate. One possibility is that the equilibrium unemployment rate, or NAIRU, has declined. The estimated value of NAIRU is generally determined in the process of estimating the Phillips Curve; it is the value of the unemployment rate consistent with equality between actual and expected inflation where expected inflation is typically proxied by lagged inflation. Historically, NAIRU has been estimated as a constant, or as a time-varying series that changes over time only due to demographic changes in the labor force. Recently, several studies have used time-varying parameter estimation techniques to look for evidence of a recent decline in NAIRU. Bob Gordon, for example, finds that, based on time-varying parameter estimates, NAIRU has declined from a relatively constant value of 6% over the previous decade to near 5 12% recently.\n\nIf the claim that NAIRU has declined recently is correct, it would obviously help explain why we were able to achieve simultaneously low rates of inflation and unemployment in 1996. But, to build confidence in this result, we would like to be able to tell a qualitative story that explains why NAIRU may have declined and find evidence in labor markets, beyond the time varying parameter estimates of NAIRU, that is consistent with it. The source of the decline in NAIRU will, hopefully, help us to answer a very important related question. To the extent that there has been a decline in NAIRU, is it likely to be permanent or transitory? This may have important implications for the inflation forecast over the coming year.\n\nI am going to develop two sets of explanations for the surprisingly good performance of inflation relative to unemployment. The first is that there have been a series of favorable supply shocks that have temporarily lowered inflation, for a given unemployment rate, resulting in the appearance of a decline in NAIRU. In this case, absent further favorable supply shocks, inflation performance will not be as favorable for any given unemployment rate as we return to the historical relationship between inflation and unemployment.\n\nSecond, there may have been a longer-lasting change in the bargaining power of workers relative to firms and/or in the competitive pressure on firms that has resulted in unusual restraint in wage gains and price increases. One explanation in this genre is the \"job insecurity\" hypothesis and a second is the \"absence of pricing leverage\" hypothesis. Both are consistent with anecdotal accounts we read about almost daily in the newspapers and hear from businesses, but both of these explanations are difficult to quantify and therefore to test.\n\nLet's begin with the favorable supply shock story. We start with a simple version of the Phillips Curve which relates inflation to expected inflation and the gap between unemployment rate and NAIRU. Estimated versions of such a Phillips Curve typically also take some supply shocks into account. Supply shocks refer to exogenous changes in sectoral prices (or wages) which may affect the overall price (or wage) level and, at least temporarily, the overall inflation rate. The classic examples would be legislated changes in the minimum wage,\n\nweather-related movements in food prices, and politically inspired changes in energy prices. An adverse supply shock --an increase in oil prices, for example --would raise the rate of inflation at any given unemployment rate.\n\nTraditionally, NAIRU is estimated assuming an absence of supply shocks. It is the unemployment rate that is consistent with stable inflation in the long run, or, alternatively, is consistent with stable inflation in the absence of supply shocks.\n\nWe can also calculate a short-run or effective NAIRU as the unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation given whatever supply shocks are in play at the moment. In the case of an adverse supply shock, for example, the short-run or effective NAIRU would be higher than the long-run NAIRU. This simply means that the unemployment rate required to hold overall inflation constant in the face of an increase in oil prices has to be high enough so that inflation in the non-oil sectors will slow on average.\n\nBefore we can tell the story about favorable supply shocks, I should note that 1996 featured an unusual coincidence of adverse supply shocks. First, the minimum wage was increased; this should boost overall wage gains, labor costs and hence prices. Second, both food and energy prices increased faster than other prices. As a result of the food and energy price increases, there were wide gaps between overall and core measures of inflation for both the PPI and the CPI. The overall CPI increased about %4 percentage point more than the core CPI and overall PPI increased more than two percentage points faster than core PPI.\n\nHowever, because minimum wage increases, food and energy price increases are routinely included as shock terms in estimated Phillips Curves, these adverse shocks should not result in a systematic under-prediction of inflation and hence any sign of a change in NAIRU. But, despite the acceleration in the overall CPI from 2.5% over 1995 to 3.3% over 1996, the inflation performance was judged to be extraordinarily good because core measures of inflation declined. The core CPI fell, for example, from 3% to 2.6%. Even the overall GDP price index declined, reflecting the combination of a decline in core inflation, a larger weight for computer prices, different treatment of medical costs, and a smaller weight for food and energy in the GDP price index compared with the CPI. It is this well-contained behavior of the core CPI and the GDP price index that is not predicted by typical Phillips Curves and therefore suggests a decline in NAIRU.\n\nOne explanation of this decline in core inflation is a series of favorable supply shocks in play over the last year or two. The key is that these supply shocks are generally not included in estimated Phillips Curves, so that Phillips Curves missed their effects and over-predicted inflation. The first favorable supply shock is the widely celebrated decline in health care costs, associated with the movement of firms to managed care plans and changes in the medical care market which lowered medical price inflation; this reduced benefit costs to firms, lowered the increase in overall labor costs, and reduced the pressure to raise prices. The second favorable supply shock is the especially rapid decline in computer prices over the past year or two. Third, import prices declined over 1996, due to both lower inflation abroad and the recent appreciation of the dollar. The decline in import prices has a direct effect on the core CPI through the lower cost of purchasing imported goods and an indirect effect on the GDP deflator through the restraint of lower import prices on pricing decisions by U.S. producers.\n\nI am not going to support this discussion today with a full recitation of the data. However, each of these developments can be measured, each works to lower \"core\" inflation over the last year or two, and, collectively, these favorable supply shocks explain at least some\n\nportion of the apparent decline in NAIRU. Because the supply shocks are likely to be temporary, part of the apparent decline in NAIRU is likely to be transitory and we may therefore see some gradual increase in core inflation this year, depending to be sure, on what happens to computer prices, benefit costs, and import prices. On the other hand, any resulting increase in core inflation may be more than offset in 1997 by a slowing of the increase in food prices and a partial reversal of the recent increase in energy prices.\n\nLet me now turn to the more challenging stories, job insecurity and absence of pricing leverage. The anecdotal \"evidence\" in each case is impressive, but it is, nevertheless, difficult to quantify these forces and therefore test their significance and measure their importance. But let's at least make an effort to understand the stories.\n\nThe worker insecurity hypothesis seeks to explain the recent favorable inflation performance as a labor market event, in which workers have been cowed by the recent spate of job losses (or threats of job losses) and, as a result, are less likely to push for additional wage increases, even in tight labor markets.\n\nTwo issues have to be addressed relative to this hypothesis. Is there evidence in labor market data, other than via Phillips Curve equations, to support this hypothesis? Is the decline in NAIRU resulting from worker insecurity permanent or temporary?\n\nThere are two types of evidence supporting the hypothesis that workers have become less secure about their jobs. The first is that the proportion of workers who have suffered a permanent job loss in recent years looks high relative to the late 1980s when the aggregate unemployment rate was similar to its current level; this is consistent with the increased reports of corporate downsizing we've seen in this decade. For example, according to data BLS released this past fall, the percent of workers who were displaced from their job between 1993 and 1995 was nearly as high as in the previous recession, and well above the displacement rates seen in the late 1980s. Similarly, the percentage of unemployed who were permanently separated from their job has continued to trend up. These surveys also suggest that a broader spectrum of workers have been affected by permanent job losses. The idea that unskilled blue-collar workers are the only group with significant risk of a permanent job loss is no longer valid. Job displacement rates are up for white-collar workers, more educated workers, and those with greater tenure.\n\nThe second piece of evidence supporting the job insecurity story is that workers appear reluctant to voluntarily leave their jobs because of an increased apprehension about the difficulty in finding a comparable new job. Although there is anecdotal evidence that fears about skill obsolescence and loss of health insurance are important factors influencing worker concerns, the sources of worker anxiety are difficult to measure with any accuracy. Nonetheless, there does appear to be a smaller flow of quits into unemployment than would be expected at this stage of the expansion.\n\nIn a sense, the deterioration in workers' perception of their job security can be viewed as an outward shift in their labor supply schedule --a decline in the reservation wage, if you will. The result of this shift in the supply curve is a decline in the real wage to a new equilibrium level. And during the transition to this new equilibrium, nominal wage growth will fall short of its normal relationship to prices and the unemployment rate, appearing as transitory decline in NAIRU. Whether the decline in job security also leads to a permanent decline in NAJIRU is a more difficult issue to assess.\n\nAn alternative or complementary explanation for the surprising inflation performance is the perception of an absence of pricing leverage on the part of firms. In this story, the dynamics of the inflation process seem almost reversed from the way I have traditionally modeled them. The traditional econometric model specifies prices as set in relation to costs. The mark-up may vary cyclically, but the major source of cyclical rise in inflation is via a cyclical rise in costs, primarily through cyclical increases in wage costs, in turn due to demand pressure in the labor market. The firm passes forward such increases in costs. The real action is in the labor market. Today, by contrast, it appears that the dynamics have been reversed. The point of departure is the perceived inability of firms to pass forward increases in costs. That dictates an obsession by firms with containing costs. That means bargaining aggressively to avoid increases in wage costs, intensive efforts to offset any wage increases with productivity gains, and the necessity of absorbing in profit margins increases in costs that cannot be offset.\n\nThe absence of pricing leverage is generally attributed to a perception of increased competition. Every firm fears being the first to raise prices and suffer, as a consequence, an increase in its relative prices and a decline in market share. There are at least two problems with this explanation. First, we have to identify the source of the fundamental change in competitive pressure. Second, an exogenous increase in competitive pressure should initially compress profit margins, whereas firm profitability has remained very high.\n\nThe absence of pricing leverage may simply reflect the fact that product markets are not tight, compared to labor markets. There may be some excess demand in labor markets, but the effect on wages and prices is being offset for the moment by favorable supply shocks. On the other hand, capacity utilization rates show no signs of excess demand in product markets. It is excess demand that gives pricing leverage to firms. The absence of pricing leverage by firms, as a result of an absence of demand pressure, induces firms to work hard to restrain wage increases or to offset them with productivity gains.\n\nLet me sum up my interpretation of the recent unemployment and inflation experience. Economic performance has truly been excellent over the past year with a particularly impressive combination of low core inflation and low unemployment in 1996. But this performance does not suggest that the business cycle is dead or that the Phillips Curve is no longer relevant. The decline in core inflation during 1996 most likely reflects the role of a coincidence of favorable supply shocks. Developments in labor markets over the last few years do provide a hint of a modest decline in NAIRU, but the evidence is not definitive and it remains uncertain whether any decline in NAIRU is temporary or permanent. Consequently, a prudent monetary policy would be based on a working assumption that the underlying trend of inflation has been stabilized in the past couple of years and that we shall have to maintain a close watch for signs that inflationary pressures are mounting.\n\n## Challenges for Monetary Policy\n\nLet me turn now to the implications of the economic outlook for challenges to monetary policy. I'll discuss five challenges, three faced and met earlier in the expansion, one currently in play, and a fifth that deserves attention.\n\nThe first challenge was the more erratic and, on average, slower pace of recovery following the last recession. This was due, in large measure, to the weight of a series of structural imbalances inherited from the previous expansion. In response to the unique features of the recovery, monetary policy remained unusually stimulative long into the expansion, with\n\nthe Federal Reserve maintaining a 3% nominal federal funds rate and near-zero real federal funds rate for three years into the current expansion.\n\nThe next challenge came when the \"headwinds\" began to abate and the economy was poised to move to more robust growth in 1994, at a time when the unemployment rate had already declined from its cyclical high to closer to estimates of full employment. The timing and aggressiveness of Federal Reserve tightening over 1994 met the second challenge, preventing overheating.\n\nThe third challenge was to adjust monetary policy, once the economy showed signs of slowing in early 1995, to avoid overkill and set the foundation for trend growth near full employment with stable inflation. The two most common errors in cyclical monetary policy are, first, waiting too long to tighten and then not tightening aggressively enough in the initial stages; and, second, eventually overdoing tightening as a result of the lags in monetary policy. When monetary policy moves to tighten, the effects are initially, because of lags, small and hard to detect. So the temptation is to continue to tighten until the economy does slow. By this time the delayed effects of past tightening are building and threaten a sharper than desired slowdown. In late 1995 and early 1996, monetary policy reversed a small measure of the tightening over the previous year, preventing the sharp rise in interest rates over 1994 from producing a more persistent period of below-trend growth or even a recession.\n\nThe fourth challenge, which we continue to face, is to preserve the expansion without allowing an acceleration in inflation. This challenge is heightened by uncertainty about the level of NAIRU and about the permanence of an apparent recent decline in NAIRU. Because of the lags, it is widely appreciated that it is desirable for monetary policy to be forward looking. But forward looking policy is predicated on confidence in a model that can predict how current and prospective economic conditions will affect inflation going forward. Uncertainty about NAIRU has, in my view, made monetary policy more cautious in responding to forecasts of inflation that depend on the relationship between the current unemployment rate and some estimate of NAIRU. At the prevailing unemployment rate, the challenge is to be especially watchful for early signs of mounting price pressures and, if necessary, to be at least swiftly reactive to limit and then reverse any acceleration of inflation that might occur. If the unemployment rate declines, however, a more forward-looking approach may quickly become appropriate.\n\nThe fifth challenge is to embed what has, to date, clearly been excellent short-run adjustments of policy to sustain the expansion and prevent an acceleration of inflation in an overall approach that will achieve the Federal Reserve's long-run objective of price stability. Achieving price stability is in our legislative mandate because it is the contribution we can make over the long run to enhancing economic efficiency and setting the foundation for sustainable growth.\n\nPerhaps, this would be a good place for me to stop and you to register your opinions on some of the issues I have covered here.",

George, at the Chartered Institute of Bankers in Scotland Biennial Dinner in Edinburgh on 20/1/97.\n\nMr. Chairman, the last time we came together for this great occasion, two years ago, I was pleased to be able to report to you that the British economy was making encouraging progress.  We had, already then, seen very nearly three years of continuous and reasonably steady economic growth, which had produced a gradual fall in unemployment.  And this steady expansion had brought few of the usual tell-tale signs of emerging imbalance between overall demand in the economy and our supply-side capacity to meet that demand.  Our external current account was close to balance.  And underlying retail price inflation was then lower than it had been for a generation.  Even so, we had - as you will recall - begun to apply a touch on the monetary policy tiller to avoid being blown off course by rising world commodity prices at a time when domestic activity had already gathered pace.\n\nI am delighted to be with you again this evening and to be able to report that this encouraging progress continues.\n\nOutput has now been growing, continuously and  reasonably  steadily  -  at  an  annual  rate  of 2.2% - for very nearly five years.  Unemployment has continued to fall, almost without interruption month by month, and is now down to 1.9 million (or 6.7% of the workforce) compared with nearly 3 million (or 10.5%) at its peak, and 2.5 million (or 8.6%) two years ago.  It is of course still intolerably high - we are talking about people here not just numbers.  But unemployment is at least a great deal lower than in any other major country in Europe;  and it is falling in the UK whereas elsewhere it is all too often still rising.  Our external current account remains close to balance.  And although our rate of inflation has edged up since we were last together, from below 2½% to just over 3%, and is, it must be said, somewhat higher than in most of the rest of the industrialised world, it is still relatively low by our own standards of the past 30-odd years.\n\nThe key question now - as it was last time - is can we keep it going?\n\nThings  have  moved  on  over  the  past  two  years.    We  did  in  fact  successfully  weather  the commodity price squall, which blew itself out quite quickly - though oil prices have recently been something of an exception.  And the economy slowed during 1995.  But we are now seeing a new and freshening wind blowing in particular from the household sector of the domestic economy.\n\nA sharp pick-up in the rate of growth of the money supply in 1995 provided an early indication that demand growth was likely to accelerate.  And money supply growth has remained strong throughout the whole of the past year.\n\nFaster growth of consumer spending became evident in the first half of 1996 and has been sustained.  And from the middle of last year this began to feed through into output - which was initially held back, and is possibly still being affected by a run-down of stocks.\n\nNow the fact is that no-one can tell you with any great confidence just when the increase in demand is likely to begin to create economic imbalance and spill over into rising inflation.  But we can be reasonably certain that money supply growth at around 9-10% a year, as we have seen it now since the beginning of last year, and growth in consumer spending at nearly 4% a year, as we have seen over the last year, cannot be sustained for long consistently with the Government's inflation target in the medium term.  And there are signs in the recently more rapid tightening of the labour market and in the gathering recovery in the housing market, for example, that demand may be strengthening.\n\nThat, essentially, is why the Bank has been arguing that we will need at some early stage a modest pre-emptive tightening of monetary policy.  It is true that there is no immediate sign of cost or price inflation at the early stages of the production-distribution chain;  and it is true in particular that the tightening labour market has not yet resulted in an acceleration of pay settlements or earnings.  But these are backwardlooking data.  If we are to maintain that happy position, we need to anticipate what is to come, and begin to moderate the pace of the upswing before the evidence of imbalance comes through into the statistics.  Two years ago my message to you was that we needed a stitch in time to save nine, which indeed we did.  I bring you the same message again this evening.\n\nThe position is however complicated on this occasion by the recent strength of the exchange rate.  Since the summer sterling has appreciated by just over 13% in effective terms - by rather more against the major European currencies and the yen (+15-16%) but rather less against the dollar (+7%).  The speed and the size  of  sterling's  appreciation  is,  of  course,  causing  understandable  anxiety,  particularly  for  those  sectors  of manufacturing industry exposed to international competition.  Already this is beginning to affect export orders. Given that those sectors account for perhaps half of total manufacturing, which in turn accounts for nearly a quarter of total output, it is clearly a serious issue.\n\nThis creates a tension between the domestic and the external, or exchange rate, dictates of policy - a dilemma which, in one direction or the other afflicts most countries from time to time, and which we ourselves have experienced at times in the past, though not during the past few years.  The trouble in this instance is that the stronger exchange rate does not directly affect the build-up of domestic demand pressure, which is the problem we start with.  It will, if it persists, have a one-off downwards effect (directly or indirectly) on the prices of perhaps a quarter of all goods covered by the retail price index, which will reduce the RPI during the course of this year;  but this effect will gradually drop out of the 12-month calculation during 1998.  The stronger exchange rate will also, if it persists, cause the external trade balance to weaken, and by relieving to this extent the pressure of overall demand, that may have a more lasting effect on the rate of inflation.  We, of course, take these factors into account as best we can in making our forecasts of future inflation and in giving our policy advice, though there is inevitably a great deal of uncertainty over the timing and scale of their effects.  That can, nevertheless, still leave room for tension between the need to moderate the upswing in domestic demand in order to meet the Government's inflation target (of 2½% or less) not this year, but in 1998 and beyond on the one hand, and unwanted strength of the exchange rate on the other.\n\nThere is no easy monetary policy answer to this dilemma.  How far it persists depends upon just why the exchange rate suddenly strengthened as it has;  and that is not easy to explain in terms of developments in the UK alone.  Some of the suggested influences may well prove to be exaggerated or indeed reversible.  This may be true, for example, of the rise in the oil price.  It may be true, that expectations about a prospective relative rise in UK, and US, interest rates, reflecting the relative strength of our cyclical positions compared with those in Japan or continental Europe, are overdone, and they should in any event reduce as recovery takes hold in those other countries.  And present market perceptions of the euro as a potentially weak currency if the Maastricht convergence criteria are not rigorously enforced, may also come to be seen to be exaggerated.  There is in fact some suggestion, in currency options prices, that markets see a larger downside than upside risk to sterling against the DM in the course of this year.  In the meantime, policy judgments are likely to remain unusually difficult.\n\nWhen we confronted a similar dilemma in the 1980s, the domestic expansion was allowed for some time to continue unchecked, but in the end we were driven to bring it to a jarring halt.  I do not suggest for a moment that we are anywhere close to that situation now.  Our aim is precisely to avoid that.  But that experience does illustrate  that,  in  the  final  analysis,  there  could  be  real  dangers  in  allowing  justified  concern  about  the exchange rate to deflect us for too long from moving gradually to moderate the upswing.  I emphasise the words 'gradually' and 'moderate'.  The choice ultimately in this situation is not whether or not;  it is sooner or later, less or more.\n\nOur present dilemma - and it is a real dilemma - serves to illuminate the debate  about  the economics pros and cons of European Monetary Union, and the difficult decisions that will face all EU countries in little over a year from now.  On the one hand, the real attractions - to manufacturers in particular - of exchange rate fixity within the euro area, are amply apparent.  On the other hand, our dilemma - and we are not alone in this dilemma within Europe - points up the problem that would arise if the single European monetary policy - the single interest rates - does not meet the domestic monetary policy needs of all the euro-member countries.  This could happen for a number of reasons - related to different cyclical positions, different fiscal positions, or as a result of external shocks or structural changes.\n\nThe famous Maastricht criteria for sustainable convergence that are to be met, according to the Treaty, before a country qualifies for the Single Currency were designed precisely to reduce the risks of tensions of this sort arising after the start.  I should like to think that the political leaders across Europe, who will take the decisions, all really appreciate the crucial importance of sustainable convergence to the success of the venture and that they do not see it just as a technical obstacle to their wider aspirations - I should like to think that.\n\nSo, Mr. Chairman, some difficult decisions lie ahead.  The period up to your next biennial dinner will be momentous.  But that should not obscure the fact that our immediate economic prospects remain encouraging.  I do not know of any serious economic forecaster who does not expect the economy to continue to grow over the next two year, or unemployment to continue to fall.  The challenge is to ensure that we can still say that in two years' time.\n\nBIS Review   5/1997",

         "## Bank  of  France  reports  industrial activity increased in all sectors in December 1996 BANK OF FRANCE, MONTHLY BUSINESS SURVEY, December 1996.\n\nIn  December,  according  to  the  business  leaders  surveyed  by  the  Banque  de France, industrial  activity increased  in  all  sectors,  except  in  the  intermediate  goods  sector, where  it  remained  stable.    The  food  processing  and  consumer  goods  sectors  were  the  most buoyant.\n\nThe capacity utilization rate remained virtually unchanged.\n\nOverall  demand firmed  on  both  the  domestic  market  and  the  export  market, where the strongest flow of orders continued  to  come  from  the  United  States  and  Asia.    The competitiveness  of  French  products  was  bolstered  by  the  recovery  of  currencies  that  had weakened earlier, including the United States dollar, sterling and the Italian lira.\n\nOrder books approached normal levels in all sectors, except in the intermediate goods sector, where they remained too low. Inventories decreased  with  the  end  of  the  lorry drivers' strike, and now appear to be normal in the capital goods and automobile sectors.\n\nIn the coming months , most sectors are expected to continue to show moderate growth.\n\nCommodity prices as a whole showed practically no change. Finished product prices held up overall, despite the continuing high level of competition.\n\nInvestment programmes  were  limited  to  renewing  obsolete  equipment  or  to meeting  the  desire  to  increase  firms'  productivity  in  an  intensely  competitive  international environment.    There  were  few  plans  for  output  capacity  increases  and  in  all  cases  were dependent on stronger growth in demand.\n\nRetail sales in  November and December posted a slight decline compared with the corresponding period of 1995.\n\nActivity in the construction sector fell  back  in  the  fourth  quarter  and  posted  a sharp twelve-month drop.\n\nEmployment levels varied little in industry, with the exception of the automobile sector,  where  they  posted  a  further  substantial  decline.    They  remained  stable  in  the  market services and retail sectors, but fell sharply in the building industry.",

         "Testimony of the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, before the Committee on the Budget of the US Senate on 21/1/97.",
         "Mr.  Greenspan  gives  some  personal  perspectives  on  the  current  economic situation in the United States Testimony of the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, before the Committee on the Budget of the US Senate on 21/1/97.\n\nMr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am pleased to appear here today. In just a few weeks the Federal Reserve Board will submit its semiannual report on monetary policy  to  the  Congress.  That  report  and  my  accompanying  testimony  will  cover  in  detail  our assessment of the outlook for the U.S. economy and the challenges facing monetary policy. This morning, I would like to offer some personal perspectives on the current economic situation.\n\nI  think  it  is  fair  to  say  that  the  overall  performance  of  the  U.S.  economy  has continued  to  surpass  most  forecasters'  expectations.  The  current  cyclical  upswing  is  now approaching six years in duration, and the economy has retained considerable vigor, with few signs of the imbalances and inflationary tensions that have disrupted past expansions. Although the data for the fourth quarter are still incomplete, it is apparent that real gross domestic product posted an increase in the neighborhood of 3 percent over the four quarters of 1996. This increase may  seem  quite  moderate  compared  with  the  gains  registered  in  some  earlier  years  of  the postwar  period;  however,  at  a  time  when  the  working-age  population  is  expanding  relatively slowly and unemployment is already low, this economic growth is appreciable  indeed.  It  was enough  to  generate  more  than  2½  million  new  payroll  jobs  last  year  and  to  cause  the unemployment rate to edge down to 5¼ percent -- a figure roughly matching the low of the last cyclical  upswing,  in  the  late  1980s.  But,  in  contrast  to  that  earlier  period,  we  have  not experienced a broad increase in inflation; in fact, by some important measures of price trends, inflation actually slowed a bit in 1996.\n\nThe balance and solidity of the expansion last year can be seen in the composition of the growth. Notably, consumers appear to have been rather conservative in their spending. In some instances, they may have been constrained by the debt-service burdens accumulated over the  previous  few  years;  but  in  the  aggregate,  households  experienced  an  enormous  further accretion  of  net  worth  as  the  stock  market  continued  to  climb  at  a  breathtaking  rate.  Judging from historical patterns, such an increase in wealth might have inspired households to spend an enlarged  share  of  their  current  income;  but,  if  we  take  the  available  data  at  face  value, households  appear  instead  to  have  set  aside  a  greater  share  of  their  income  for  financial investment.  Perhaps  Americans  are  finally  becoming  conscious  of  the  need  to  accumulate additional assets to ensure not only that they can handle temporary interruptions in employment but also that they will have the wherewithal to enjoy a lengthy retirement down the road.\n\nBe that as it may, the increased flow of private savings -- and a reduced call upon those  savings  by  the  Treasury  --  helped  to  fund  substantial  increases  in  fixed  investment  last year.  Homebuilding  activity  was  up  considerably;  notably,  single-family  housing  starts  were robust once again and helped to push the nation's homeownership rate to a fifteen-year high. In addition,  business  fixed  investment  posted  another  strong  advance.  Firms  acquired  large amounts of computing and telecommunications equipment in particular, seeking to enhance the efficiency of their operations as well as their overall productive capacity. At the same time, they accumulated inventories rather cautiously: Stock-to-sales ratios, which had risen in 1995, were in  many  cases  near  historic  lows  as  of  November  1996,  the  most  recent  month  for  which statistical information is available.\n\nThe growing economy had beneficial effects on the finances of many states and localities, which consequently could spend more on needed infrastructure and vital services and,\n\nin some instances, trim taxes. Of course, overall government sector purchases were held down by the  ongoing  efforts  to  reduce  the  federal  deficit.  It  clearly  was  private  demand  that  drove economic growth last year.\n\nTo be more specific, it was domestic private demand that did so, for net exports fell, on balance, in 1996. The volume of goods and services we sold abroad grew appreciably, despite moderate economic expansion by our major trading partners, but our imports continued to grow at a rapid clip. In fact, imports provided a safety valve in a U.S. economy marked by a high degree of resource utilization.\n\nI've already noted that our unemployment rate reached the lowest level in some time. Moreover, throughout the year, we heard reports from around the country that qualified workers  were  in  tight  supply.  Although  increases  in  hourly  compensation  remained  relatively subdued -- an important fact to which I shall return in a few moments -- they did become more sizable,  and  they  raised  unit  costs  when  employers  were  unable  to  enhance  productivity commensurately.  Thanks  to  the  very  substantial  additions  to  facilities  in  the  past  few  years, physical capacity in the manufacturing sector was not greatly strained.\n\nThe  question  is,  of  course,  where  do  we  go  from  here?  Can  we  continue  to achieve significant gains in real activity while avoiding inflationary excesses? Because monetary policy works with a lag, it is not the conditions prevailing today that are critical but rather those likely to prevail six to twelve months, or even longer, from now. Hence, as difficult as it is, we must  arrive  at  some  judgment  about  the  most  probable  direction  of  the  economy  and  the distribution of risks around that expectation.\n\nFortunately, economic events  are  not  wholly  random  and  unforecastable.  There are  certain  principles,  and  certain  empirical  regularities  in  behavioral  relations,  that  we  can follow  with  some  degree  of  confidence.  For  example,  capital  investment  responds  in  a predictable  way  to  the  rate  of  growth  of  the  economy,  expected  profitability,  and  the  cost  of capital.  Similarly,  housing  activity,  with  some  qualifications,  moves  inversely  with  mortgage rates. And the largest component of final demand, personal consumption expenditures, generally follows income over time. Many of these relationships are embedded in the traditional notion of the  business  cycle  developed  by  Wesley  Clair  Mitchell  three-quarters  of  a  century  ago  and worked out with Arthur F. Burns,  one  of  my  predecessors,  in  the  definitive  tome,  Measuring Business Cycles. Their insights remain relevant today.\n\nEven so, each cycle tends to have its own identifying characteristic. For example, in the late 1980s and the recessionary period of the early 1990s, the economy was dominated by the sharp fall in the market value of commercial real estate; because such real estate served as a major source of loan collateral, the drop in its value had a profoundly restrictive influence on the willingness  and  ability  of  commercial  banks  to  lend.  As  you  may  recall,  at  that  time,  I characterized the economy as trying to advance in the face of fifty-mile-an-hour headwinds. The severe  credit  restraint  was  only  grudgingly  responsive  to  the  extended  efforts  of  the  Federal Reserve to ease monetary conditions.\n\nSimilarly, the dramatic rise of inflation and of inflation expectations in the 1970s was key in shaping the cyclical patterns of that period. One manifestation was the impetus to spending on houses, cars, and other consumer durables from buyers' efforts to beat future price increases.  Countering  this  inflation  required  a  major  monetary  tightening,  which  moved  both nominal and real interest rates up sharply and led to substantial contractions in housing and other interest-sensitive sectors in the early 1980s.\n\nIn  contrast,  as  I've  mentioned  several  times  to  the  Congress  over  the  past  few years, perhaps the dominant characteristic of the current expansion is low inflation and quiescent inflation  expectations,  which  have  helped  create  a  financial  environment  conducive  to  strong capital spending and longer-range planning generally. I emphasized this point in our HumphreyHawkins testimony of a year ago. Since then, increases in hourly compensation as measured by the employment cost index have continued to fall far short of what they would have been had historical  relationships  between  compensation  gains  and  the  degree  of  labor  market  tightness held.\n\nReaching some judgment about the reasons for this departure from past patterns is important. As I see it,  heightened job insecurity explains a significant  part  of  the  restraint  on compensation and the consequent muted price inflation.\n\nSurveys of workers have highlighted this extraordinary state of affairs. In 1991, at the bottom of the recession, a survey of workers at large firms indicated that 25 percent feared being  laid  off.  In  1996,  despite  the  sharply  lower  unemployment  rate  and  the  demonstrably tighter labor market, the same survey organization found that 46 percent were fearful of a job layoff.\n\nThe continued reluctance of workers to leave their jobs to seek other employment as  the  labor  market  has  tightened  provides  further  evidence  of  such  concern,  as  does  the tendency toward longer labor union contracts. For many decades, contracts rarely exceeded three years.  Today,  one  can  point  to  five-  and  six-year  contracts  --  contracts  that  are  commonly characterized by an emphasis on job security and that involve only modest wage increases. The low level of work stoppages of recent years also attests to concern about job security.\n\nThus,  the  willingness  of  workers  to  trade  off  smaller  increases  in  wages  for greater job security seems to be reasonably well-documented for this particular business-cycle expansion.  The  unanswered  question  is  why  this  insecurity  has  persisted  even  as  the  labor market  has,  by  all  objective  measures,  tightened  considerably.  One  possibility  is  the  ongoing concern of workers about job skill obsolescence. The reality of this obsolescence is evidenced by the marked expansion of on-the-job training programs, especially in technical areas, in many of the nation's corporations. No longer can one expect to obtain all of one's lifetime job skills with a  high-school  or  college  diploma.  Indeed,  continuing  adult  education  is  perceived  to  be increasingly necessary to retain a job.\n\nCertainly,  there  are  other  possible  explanations  of  the  softness  in  compensation growth  in  the  past  few  years.  The  sharp  deceleration  in  health  care  costs,  of  course,  is  cited frequently.  Another  possibility  is  the  heightened  pressure  on  firms  and  their  workers  in industries  that  compete  internationally.  Domestic  deregulation  has  had  similar  effects  on  the intensity of competitive forces in some industries. In addition, the continued decline in the share of the private workforce in labor unions has likely made wages more responsive to market forces -- indeed, the converse is also true in that the new competitive realities have in many instances undermined union strength. In any event, although I do not doubt that all these explanations are relevant, I would be surprised if any were dominant.\n\nAnother potential explanation is that persistently low price inflation is constraining wage increases. Historical evidence clearly indicates that price inflation is a factor in wage change. But, if the causation is running mainly from product markets, where prices are set, to labor markets, where wages are set, then we would expect to see some squeeze on profit margins. Clearly, this is not the case at present. Rather, owing in part to the subdued behavior of\n\nwages, profits and rates of return on capital have risen to high levels. The high rates of return, in turn,  seem  to  be  inducing  competitive  pressures  that  limit  the  ability  of  firms  to  raise  prices relative to their underlying cost structures because they fear that competitors anxious to capture a greater share of the market will not follow suit. Thus, the evidence seems more consistent with the view that wage restraint is damping price increases than the other way around.\n\nIf  the  job  insecurity  paradigm  that  I  have  outlined  is  the  key,  then  we  must recognize  that,  as  I  indicated  in  last  February's  Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony,  'suppressed wage cost growth as a consequence of job insecurity can be carried only so far. At some point in the  future,  the  trade-off  of  subdued  wage  growth  for  job  security  has  to  come  to  an  end.'  In short, this implies that even if the level of real wages remains permanently lower as a result of the  experience  of  the  past  few  years,  the  relatively  modest  wage  gains  we've  seen  are  a transitional rather than a lasting phenomenon. The unknown is how long the transition will last. Indeed, the recent pickup in some measures of wages suggests that the transition may already be running its course. If so, the important question from a monetary policy point of view is whether prospective labor market conditions will be consistent with the maintenance of satisfactory price performance.\n\nI would like to conclude with a brief discussion of some issues of measurement and economic data that may be useful as you begin your deliberations on the 1998 budget. One issue you will have to grapple with is the growing consensus that the consumer price index -and  other  broad  price  measures  that  rely  heavily  on  CPI  data  in  their  construction  --  are substantially overstating changes in the true cost of living. From your perspective, one important implication  of  the  CPI  bias  is  that  it  creates  an  automatic  and  presumably  unintended  real increase in social security and other indexed federal benefits and a real cut in indexed individual income taxes each year. Less widely recognized is the fact  that,  for  a  given  level  of  nominal spending, the upward bias in the CPI in many cases is mirrored in a downward bias in estimates of  real  spending;  this  muddies  the  interpretation  of  both  recent  economic  developments  and longer-run trends in our economic performance.\n\nSeveral researchers have attempted to quantify the bias in the CPI and other broad measures  of  prices.  One  set  of  studies  has  examined  the  detailed  microstatistical  evidence  on price measurement. The Boskin Commission drew heavily on these studies and concluded that the CPI is currently overstating changes in the true cost of living by approximately 1 percentage point  per  year.  In  addition  to  some  technical  factors  associated  with  its  construction,  the  CPI overstates inflation because of the slow introduction of new products and inadequate adjustment for quality improvements.\n\nRecently, researchers at the Federal Reserve Board have looked at the measurement issue from a macroeconomic perspective. This analysis, which questions whether the pattern implied by the published price, output, and productivity statistics makes sense, also suggests that the inflation rate is overstated. In particular, the research finds that measured real output and productivity in the service sector of the economy are implausibly weak, given that the return  to  the  owners  of  these  businesses  that  is  implicit  in  our  aggregate  statistics  on  GDP apparently has  been  well-maintained.  The  published  data  indicate  that  the  level  of  output  per hour in several service-producing industries has been falling for more than two decades -- that is, that firms in these industries have been getting less and less efficient for more than twenty years. This  pattern  is  highly  unlikely.  Price  mismeasurement  seems  to  be  the  most  probable explanation  of  the  data  anomalies,  and  the  order  of  magnitude  appears  consistent  with  the microstatistical results.\n\nThe evidence that inflation has been slower and that real growth has been faster than  the  official  measures  indicate  is  welcome,  in  part  because  it  suggests  that  the  nation's current level of economic well-being is higher than we had thought. But I want to make clear that revising our historical estimates of real growth to incorporate better price data would have no  material  effect  on  measures  of  the  degree  of  resource  utilization,  because  such  a  revision implies faster growth in potential output, as well as actual output; accordingly, it does not alter the relationship between resource utilization and inflation. Nor does it change the outlook for the federal  budget  deficit,  apart  from  any  modifications  to  the  indexing  formulas  for  entitlements and income taxes.\n\nCertainly, the judgment that aggregate productivity has been growing faster than indicated  by  the official statistics  seems  reasonable  in  light of the significant  business restructurings and extraordinary improvements in technology in recent years. I do not mean to imply,  however,  that  we  should  assume  that  the  full  productivity  gain  from  information technology has already been reaped. Clearly, it takes some time for firms to adopt production techniques that translate a major new technology into increased output. In an intriguing parallel, electric motors in the late nineteenth century were well-known as a technology but were initially integrated into production systems that were designed for steam-driven power plants. Not until the  gradual  conversion  of  previously  vertical  factories  into  horizontal  facilities,  mainly  in  the 1920s, were firms able to take full advantage of the synergies implicit in the electric dynamo and thus  achieve  dramatic  increases  in  productivity.  Analogously,  not  all  of  today's  production systems can be easily integrated with new information and communication technologies. Some existing equipment cannot be controlled by computer, for example. Thus, the full exploitation of even the current generation of information and communication equipment may occur over quite a few years and only after a considerably updated stock of physical capital has been put in place.\n\nWhile such a scenario is quite plausible, we cannot be certain when, or if, it will occur. Thus, we must be vigilant to ensure that our economy remains sufficiently flexible for entrepreneurial  initiatives.  And  we  must  continue  our  efforts  to  further  enhance  productivity growth  by  raising  national  saving  and  spurring  capital  formation.  Attaining  a  higher  national saving  rate  quite  soon  is  crucial,  particularly  in  view  of  the  anticipated  shift  in  the  nation's demographics and associated pressures on federal retirement and health programs in the first few decades  of  the  next  century.  Reducing  the  size  of  the  federal  budget  deficit,  and  over  time moving the unified budget into surplus, would go a substantial way in that direction.\n\nBIS Review   5/1997",

         "Dr. Brash explains the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's new inflation target, and New  Zealander's  expectations  about  inflation  and  growth Address  by  the  Governor  of  the Reserve  Bank  of  New  Zealand,  Dr.  Donald  T.  Brash,  to  the  Canterbury  Employers'  Chamber  of Commerce in Christchurch on 23/1/97.\n\n## Introduction\n\nAs perhaps you know, this is the fourth time on which I have been invited to address the Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce at your first luncheon meeting of the New Year and I want to use the occasion to talk about two issues.\n\nFirst, I want to talk about the new Policy Targets Agreement, amending the inflation target from 0 to 2 percent to 0 to 3 percent, signed last month. And secondly, I want to talk about the expectations  which  we  New  Zealanders  have  about  both  inflation  and  economic  growth.  In  some important respects, I believe that those expectations are quite unrealistic.\n\n## The new inflation target\n\nFirst, the new Policy Targets Agreement. There have been two changes made in the new PTA, but I suspect that to the general public the only difference between the new Agreement and all of the earlier ones is that the new Agreement has changed the 'definition' of price stability from 0 to 2 percent to 0 to 3 percent, while making it clear that delivering that price stability remains the single  objective  of  monetary  policy  and  constitutes  the  best  way  in  which  the  Reserve  Bank  can contribute to New Zealand's economic development.\n\nSome will ask in anger why the inflation target is still so low, and why the Bank will continue to focus monetary policy on delivering that target, when there are other objectives - such as economic growth, employment, and export competitiveness - which are at least as important and in many respects more so. Others will feel betrayed that the ceiling of the inflation target has been raised from 2 to 3 percent, or that the mid-point of the target has been raised from 1 percent to 1.5 percent, particularly given the fact that the two largest parties in Parliament were both strong advocates of a mid-point of 1 percent during the last election campaign. I want to try to respond to both groups of critics.\n\nIn  many ways the easiest critics to respond  to  are  those  who  feel  that  the  inflation target  is  still  too  low,  or  that,  given  the  extent  to  which  the  economy  has  been  slowing  in  recent months and the extent of the pressures on the export sector, the Bank's objectives should have been widened to include those other objectives. For there is in fact no evidence that monetary policy can, by tolerating a  little  more  inflation,  engineer  a  sustainably  higher  rate  of  growth,  or  a  sustainably higher  level  of  employment,  or  a  sustainable  improvement  in  export  competitiveness.  To  be  sure, monetary policy can engineer faster growth, higher employment and improved exporter competitiveness in the short term - by tolerating a bit more inflation right now, there is  not  much doubt that growth and employment would be a little higher in 1997 than otherwise, and that exporters would enjoy the benefits of a lower exchange rate. Most of that faster growth and higher employment would be bought at the cost of tricking working New Zealanders into accepting a reduction in their real wages, as prices rose ahead of wages. However, it would not last. Before too long, people would recognise the deception and would demand compensation in the form of higher wages and salaries. Within a very short time, inflation would be rising, growth would be back to its previous, lower, level and we would be left contemplating the cost of reducing inflation again - and nobody should forget the very substantial one-off costs, in terms of unemployment and lost output, incurred in reducing inflation from levels above 15 percent in the mid-1980s to our current situation of price stability in the early and mid-1990s.\n\nNot only is there no evidence that tolerating more inflation can engineer sustainably faster  real  growth,  there  is  now  overwhelming  evidence  that  high  inflation  positively  damages  the way  in  which  the  economy  works  -  reduces  the  capacity  for  sustainable  growth  and  higher employment,  and  of  course  also  does  huge  social  damage,  through  the  arbitrary  redistribution  of income and wealth which it creates.\n\nThere  is  also  very  considerable  evidence  that  even  quite  low  rates  of  inflation  do damage  to  growth  and  employment,  and  virtually  no  evidence  that  inflation  actually  helps  those objectives. This is why the second of the two changes in the Policy Targets Agreement makes clear that  it  is  precisely  in  order  to  enable  monetary  policy  to  make  its  maximum  contribution  to sustainable 'growth, employment and development opportunities' that the Bank is directed to focus on maintaining a stable general level of prices.\n\nBut  isn't  there  some  concern,  fostered  in  the  popular  media  by  the  American economist Paul Krugman, that if inflation is too low it may actually damage growth? In other words, even if we accept that high or even moderate inflation is damaging, isn't it possible that central banks which are excessively obsessive about achieving no inflation might actually be harming the economy and the society they claim to be helping?\n\nThis brings me to the  second  group  of  critics,  who  are  concerned  that  in  changing from  0  to  2  percent  to  0  to  3  percent  we  have  betrayed  the  intention  of  the  Reserve  Bank  Act, requiring  that  monetary  policy  focus  exclusively  on  delivering  'stability  in  the  general  level  of prices'.\n\nThere is quite intense debate going on at the moment around the world among central bankers and academic economists about what the best specification of a low inflation target should be. There are two broad schools.\n\nThe  first  school  accepts  that  monetary  policy  should  be  focused  on  delivering predictably low inflation but argues that for several reasons that target is best expressed as inflation in a range of 1 to 3 percent. The best known advocate of this 'low positive inflation' school is probably Stanley Fischer, formerly  of  MIT  and  now  Senior  Deputy  Managing  Director  of  the  International Monetary Fund. He is visiting New Zealand next month, and it is likely that his views will receive appropriately wide media coverage at that time. He argues for this 'low positive' inflation target for various reasons, of which three are particularly important: The way in which inflation is measured results in quite a significant over-statement of actual inflation. Estimates of this over-statement in the United  States  have  suggested  that,  in  that  country,  the  'bias'  in  the  measurement  of  inflation  is between 0.7 and 2.0 percent, with bias of 1.1 percent very recently estimated by a group chaired by Michael Boskin on behalf of the United States Senate Finance Committee. For this reason, central banks should target measured inflation of at least 1 percent, because to target anything lower than that would be to target de facto deflation.\n\nBecause  at  some  stage  in  the  cycles  through  which  all  economies  go  it  may  be necessary in the interests of maintaining a high level of employment for there to be some reduction in inflation-adjusted  (or  real)  wages,  having  a  low  positive  level  of  inflation  is  more  desirable  than having  absolutely  no  inflation.  This  is  because,  with  some  inflation,  real  wages  can  be  slightly reduced  by  simply  giving  no  increase  in  nominal  wages,  whereas  with  no  inflation  reducing  real wages involves having to actually reduce nominal wages. Real wages can still be reduced, even with no inflation, but only at the expense of higher unemployment.\n\nSimilarly, it is argued that at some stage in the economic cycle it may be desirable for inflation-adjusted interest rates to fall below zero to provide a strong stimulus to demand and, since it\n\nis not generally practical for nominal interest rates to fall below zero, it is helpful if inflation is some low positive number to make negative real interest rates possible.\n\nThe second school of thought argues for a lower inflation target, often characterised by 0 to 2 percent but sometimes expressed as the level of average prices remaining stable over time. Those who favour this  view  discount  the  arguments  advanced  by  the  'low  positive'  school.  They acknowledge that there is an upward bias in the way in which inflation is measured, but argue that in most countries outside the United States that bias is almost certainly less than 1 percent and certainly could not justify a target with a mid-point of 2 percent. (The New Zealand Government Statistician is strongly convinced that there is less bias in the measurement of the New Zealand CPI than there is in the  measurement  of  the  US  CPI.)  They  acknowledge  that  it  has  not  been  easy  to  adjust  nominal wages downwards in recent years, but argue that in substantial part that is a result of the persistently high inflation most countries have experienced in recent decades, so that that should be no more than a transitional problem. Moreover, even though it may be difficult to reduce the wages of an individual employee,  that  does  not  prevent  a  significant  reduction  in  unit  labour  costs  as  a  result  both  of unchanged wages and positive productivity, and of natural turnover in the labour force. Critics of the 'low positive' school challenge the assertion that monetary policy occasionally needs to reduce real interest  rates  below  zero,  and  note  other  ways  in  which  monetary  policy  can  stimulate  demand, particularly in very open economies where movements in the exchange rate play an important role in influencing aggregate demand in the short term.\n\nThose favouring very low inflation (0 to 2 percent) argue that not only are there no advantages in tolerating a 'low positive' rate of inflation there are also significant disadvantages of even  quite  low  rates  of  inflation.  Thus  for  example  Martin  Feldstein  of  Harvard  University  (and current president of the National Bureau of Economic Research in the US) argues strongly that even very low levels  of  inflation  significantly  exacerbate  the  biases  in  the  tax  system  which  encourage consumption,  discourage  saving,  and  encourage  excessive  investment  in  residential  property.  In  a recent paper he argued that reducing measured inflation from 3 percent to 1 percent in the United States would result in a permanent increase in the level of US GDP of 1 percent, a very large gain in economic well-being even if there is some temporary loss of output required to reduce inflation to that level. Others have also argued that the interaction between inflation on the one hand and tax and financial reporting systems geared to historical cost accounting on the other creates a significant bias against capital-intensive investment projects and all investment with a long pay-back period, and a bias in favour of highly-geared companies and investments with a short pay-back period.\n\nThis debate is by no means concluded. At a major conference I attended last August in the United States, it seemed to me that a majority of those who expressed an opinion favoured a 0 to  2  percent  target,  and  that  has  been  my  own  clear  predilection.  But  given  that  there  are  very experienced  central  bankers  and  monetary  economists  in  both  schools,  it  is  at  this  stage  quite inappropriate to be dogmatic, and in my own view a target which involves doing our utmost to keep measured inflation between 0 and 3 percent is certainly consistent with the intention of the legislation within which monetary policy is operated.\n\nIndeed, irrespective of where the mid-point of the target range should be, there may be some advantage in having a slightly wider inflation target than the original 0 to 2 percent target. A number of observers have suggested that a target with a width of only 2 percentage points requires an excessive degree of activism on the part of the central bank, and that a slightly wider band, whatever its  mid-point,  would  be  sensible.  This  has  been  argued,  for  example,  by  David  Turner,  an  OECD economist.  The  tension  is  between,  on  the  one  hand,  choosing  a  target  range  which  effectively anchors inflation expectations at a low level but which is so narrow that it provokes excessive policy activism and risks loss of credibility by being frequently exceeded; and on the other, a target range which does a less effective job of anchoring inflation  expectations,  but  which  requires  less  policy\n\nactivism and protects credibility by being rarely breached. A 0 to 3 percent range seems a reasonable compromise.\n\nBut whether there is any benefit at all from a wider target band depends significantly on how a wider band, with a higher 'ceiling', affects the public's expectations of future inflation. If people understand the new target as meaning that the Bank, under Government instructions, is now willing  to  accept  1  percent  more  inflation  than  previously,  then  nothing  positive  will  have  been achieved at all - and indeed there will almost certainly be net cost involved in the change. This is because  any  increase  in  inflationary  expectations  would  tend  to  feed  into  slightly  higher  pricing decisions,  slightly  higher  wage  settlements,  slightly  greater  eagerness  to  borrow,  slightly  less enthusiasm for saving. If the Bank were willing to accept this behaviour,  'accommodate'  it  in  the jargon, we would end up with somewhat higher inflation but no other result (though of course the higher inflation would have all the negative consequences for the real economy referred to earlier). If the Bank were in fact not prepared to accommodate this increase in inflationary expectations - which it  would  not  be  I  hasten  to  emphasise  -  then  the  end  result  of  increased  inflationary  expectations would simply be higher real interest rates, somewhat lower economic growth, and somewhat higher unemployment. If that were the end result, the widening of the inflation target would not only provide no benefit it would be positively damaging.\n\nSo I think it is crucially important that nobody misunderstand what the Reserve Bank is doing. Let me be absolutely clear. The Reserve Bank has not gone soft on inflation. We will not be targeting an inflation rate of 3 percent, or even an inflation rate close to 3 percent. The Reserve Bank will be striving to keep inflation well inside the 0 to 3 percent range, and we best do that by trying to have inflation as close to the middle part of the range as possible.\n\nThat does not mean, of course, that we will always hit the target, any more than we always hit 0 to 2 percent. But it does mean that we will be constantly implementing monetary policy with the intention of having inflation as defined around the middle part of the target. If we do this, the number of occasions on which we miss the target should be minimised. Indeed, given the wider target range, there should be fewer breaches than in the past.\n\n## Inflation and growth expectations\n\nAnd this leads naturally into the second major theme of my address today, about New Zealanders' expectations about inflation and growth. It is my contention that expectations about both need to become a lot more realistic.\n\nFirst,  let's  look  at  expectations  of  inflation.  Yes,  there  are  some  encouraging  signs that New Zealanders' expectations of future inflation have fallen substantially over the last decade as actual  inflation  has  fallen.  Surveys  of  inflation  expectations  currently  suggest  that,  on  average, householders now expect year-ahead inflation to be around 3.9 percent, well down on the levels of the late  1980s  (year-ahead inflation expectations were 12.5 percent on average towards the end of 1987, and were still 8.3 percent near the end of 1989), while 10 year bond yields are slightly lower than 10 year bond yields in Australia and less than 1 percent higher than 10 year yields in the US. Wage settlements in recent years have also been one of the areas where inflation expectations seem to have  been  subdued,  with  a  great  many  wage  settlements  concluded  at  levels  which  have,  until recently at least, put little upward pressure on prices.\n\nHowever,  other  indications  are  not  nearly  as  encouraging  and  suggest  that  New Zealanders' inflation expectations are still showing the effects of the two decades of high inflation we endured in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nLook at New Zealanders' saving behaviour for example. Among those with financial assets,  how  many  are  locking  in  the  high  real  interest  rates  they  purport  to  see  by  investing  in long-term  fixed  interest  instruments,  such  as  term  bank  deposits  or  government  bonds?  The  short answer is 'very few'. To be sure, our bond yields are now comparable to international bond yields, and I used to deduce from that that the new monetary policy framework had produced a profound reduction in inflationary expectations. I now believe that I was unjustifiably optimistic, because it is foreign  savers  who  have  bought  our  bonds  in  huge  volumes,  thereby  reducing  bond  yields  to international  levels.  More  than  half  the  New  Zealand  government  bonds  on  issue  are  now  held overseas,  and  the  proportion  of  some  of  the  longer-dated  bonds  held  overseas  is  even  higher.  (In recent  months,  for  example,  more  than  70  percent  of  the  longest-dated  nominal  bond  held  by  the market has been held by overseas investors.) If we look at the term structure of the New Zealandsourced deposits of any major bank, we will see that overwhelmingly New Zealanders are holding their cash and fixed interest investments at very short term, the great bulk with a maturity of less than 12 months. Indeed, most banks have close to 90 percent of their total deposits maturing within six months, and very few have more than 5 percent of their deposits maturing beyond 12 months. By and large, most New Zealanders do not invest their savings in long-term fixed interest securities at all, despite what are, on the face of it, very attractive inflation-adjusted interest rates.\n\nWhat are we doing with our savings? Though the data on saving behaviour in New Zealand  is  not  very  good,  anecdotal  evidence  strongly  suggests  that  New  Zealanders  invest  any available saving in some form of equity investment, most typically property: a bigger house to live in, another  house  to  rent  out,  a  bigger  farm,  another  piece  of  farmland,  perhaps  a  block  of  flats,  a beach-side section, an industrial property, a commercial building, perhaps a forest  block,  anything which, the best-selling books and advertisements constantly tell us, will protect us against inflation. Protect us against inflation? But we've hardly had any inflation for the last six years and, despite the biggest change in New Zealand's constitutional arrangements this century, we have just had the new Coalition Government re-affirm the strong commitment to price stability. True, but we've certainly had two decades of high inflation in the memory of all adult New Zealanders and we all know of people who lost most of their life's savings over that period by 'making the mistake' of investing in 'secure' fixed-interest investments.\n\nI've told the true story of my uncle so many times that I am almost embarrassed to tell it again, but in my view it contains the explanation of much of the current approach to saving in New Zealand, so I will tell it again. After a life-time of orcharding in the Nelson area, he sold his orchard in 1971 and invested the sale proceeds 'safely' to provide income and security for his retirement. To be absolutely safe, he invested the entire proceeds in 18-year government stock, at the then-interest rate of 5.4 percent. Perhaps fortunately, he did not live until those bonds matured in 1989, but if he had done the $30,000 he received from selling his orchard in 1971 and which matured in 1989 would have bought him by that time just one Toyota Corolla car (with a little change). In 1971, $30,000 would have bought him 11 Toyota Corollas. In the space of just 18 years, he had lost some 90 percent of  his  retirement  nest  egg,  all  by  making  the  mistake  of  assuming  that  inflation  would  stay  at  the relatively low level of 1971.\n\nAs I say, most adult New Zealanders know stories similar to that one. Or they know stories which tell the same message in another way. Stories about people who bought a property with borrowed money in the early 1970s and watched the price of the house increase perhaps eight- or tenfold over the next 20 years, with the value of the equity actually invested in the house (after allowing for the money borrowed to help finance the purchase) increasing perhaps 30 times. Perhaps we have had  an  experience  like  that  ourselves.  Even  if  we  have  not,  we  are  assailed  by  books  and advertisements on all sides which assure us that property investment is the best way of 'protecting you against inflation', to say nothing of making the most effective use of the tax system. Even if we are  not  familiar  with  the  detail  of  the  statistics,  we  know  that  in  recent  years  residential  property prices have risen hugely in much of the country, most obviously in Auckland. According to REINZ\n\ndata, the median price of house sales in the Auckland district rose by 53 percent over the three years to December 1996, by 36 percent in the Southland district (including Queenstown), and by 29 percent in  the  Waikato/Bay  of  Plenty  district.  Even  rural  land  prices,  which  have  come  back  markedly  in some  areas  in  recent  months,  rose  by  45  percent  over  the  three  years  to  the  first  half  of  1996, according to Valuation New Zealand data. Is it any wonder therefore that New Zealanders who claim to  believe  that  consumer  price  inflation  is  more  or  less  under  control  continue  to  borrow  money enthusiastically at 9, 10, and 11 percent to acquire property?\n\nLest there be any misunderstanding, I am assuredly not against investing in property, let alone against home ownership. I own a home and a small amount of other property myself. I am merely saying that inflationary expectations are alive and well in the minds of most New Zealanders and that, until that situation changes, we will inevitably be looking at interest rates which look high in comparison to current consumer price inflation. Conversely, of course, as inflationary expectations abate, and particularly as expectations of property price inflation abate, the overall level of interest rates will tend to be lower also.\n\nAlan Greenspan, chairman of the US central bank, has on several occasions suggested that price stability obtains when economic agents - businesses and private individuals - no longer take account of the prospective change in the general price level in their economic decision-making. It is clear that we still have a little way to go.\n\nWhat about New Zealanders' expectations for economic growth? Are these too quite unrealistic? I believe that they are, at least based on current policies and attitudes.\n\nIn  the  early  1990s,  New  Zealand  achieved  real  economic  growth  of  more  than  5 percent per annum for two years in succession. We were told that we were growing faster than any other OECD economy, and at growth rates comparable to those achieved by the East Asian 'tiger' economies. We began to believe that, as a result of the economic reforms of the last decade, we too were capable of 5 or 6 percent growth indefinitely and all of us wanted to believe that. Sadly, we can not, or at least there is no evidence yet that we can. The very fast growth of 1993 and 1994 was the result in part of the one-off productivity gains resulting from the micro-economic reforms of the late 1980s  and  early  1990s,  and  in  a  greater  part  of  the  economy  having  available  a  large  number  of unemployed and underemployed people, and unutilised industrial capacity, as a result of the recession of 1991 and early 1992. As these people and this capacity were brought back into productive work, the rate of growth of real output jumped well above its sustainable rate. The rate of unemployment fell  very sharply from almost 11 percent to just over 6 percent in little more than three years and, while everybody hopes that unemployment falls further, it is clearly impossible to reduce the rate of unemployment by 5 percentage points every three years indefinitely.\n\nAs I told the members of the Auckland Chamber last year, economic growth depends primarily not on monetary policy but on real factors - on how fast the labour force is growing, on how skilled  the  labour  force  is,  on  how  much  capital  that  labour  force  has  to  work  with,  on  the technology embodied in the capital, on the efficiency of the price system in signalling where capital can  be  most  productively  invested,  on  the  nature  of  regulations  and  restrictions  which  inhibit  the effective working of the price system, and a host of other factors. Prices which are, on average, stable assist the pricing system to work effectively, and thereby help to ensure that investment takes place in the most economically sensible places. Prices which are, on average, stable tend to encourage saving, and thereby help to finance additional investment. But stable prices won't make the labour force grow more quickly,  or  make  the  labour  force  more  skilled,  or  improve  the  technology  embodied  in  the capital equipment which the labour force uses, let alone make public sector enterprises more efficient; or improve the quality of the education system; or move resources out of highly protected sectors into those which can be competitive on international markets; or improve the marketing  of  commodity exports; or even give us East-Asian-type savings rates.\n\nI  would  argue  strongly  that  price stability  has  been  helpful  to  the  improved performance of the New Zealand economy in recent years, but I have never claimed for a moment that  price  stability  has  been  the  sole  reason  for  our  better  performance,  nor  that  price  stability guarantees us strong growth in  the  future.  In  addition  to  our  ability  to  bring  back  into  productive work people and capital equipment that had become unemployed during the recession, our very much improved growth performance in recent years has been the result of a whole range of policy changes -  of  reduced  protection  and  regulation  in  the  private  sector,  of  corporatisation  and  privatisation  of many formerly inefficient public sector enterprises, of a vastly less distorting tax structure, of port reform, of labour market reform, and all the rest.\n\nIf  we  want  to  build  on  that  achievement  in  the  years  ahead,  we  must  constantly  be seeking areas where productivity can be further improved. At this stage, the aggregate numbers for the economy as a whole have led the Reserve Bank to base its economic projections on trend labour productivity growth of no more than 1.25 percent per annum. If that turns out to be the case (and 1.25 percent is close to productivity growth in other mature economies, such as the United States 1 and Australia), total growth in GDP could well be around 3 percent per annum because of growth in the labour  force.  But  growth  in  real  income  per  head,  which  must  surely  be  the  real  objective  of economic policy, will not exceed 1.25 percent annually. If we want faster growth in spending than that, we can in the short term borrow to supplement our income but, as we learned in the 1970s and 1980s, that is ultimately futile. In the longer term, higher incomes per head, and the higher spending that that can bring, can only come from finding ways to accelerate productivity growth.\n\nAnd how do we do that? Certainly not by debasing the currency through tolerating inflation. The very rapid growth of the countries of East Asia is in part simply the result of their being able to pick up 'off the shelf' modern technologies, which have taken decades to develop elsewhere. In other words, there is a substantial element of 'catch-up' in the fast growth of East Asia. But the growth  which  has  occasioned  so  much  envy  on  the  part  of  some  New  Zealanders  has  also  been achieved  in  a  particular  cultural  environment  -  a  cultural  environment  which  places  enormous emphasis  on  family  self-reliance,  which  abjures  reliance  on  the  state,  which  as  a  consequence generates a savings rate roughly double the New Zealand rate, which pursues education and training with a passion, which regards material affluence as a highly desirable goal. New Zealanders have, implicitly at least, chosen a slower growth path, by placing little emphasis on saving, by placing a more modest value on education and training, by valuing other goals more highly than affluence.\n\nI recall seeing a television programme three or four years ago about Asian students in our schools. The programme included comments from two New Zealand children that they resented the  fact  that  the  Asian  children  worked  much  harder  than  they  did.  I  don't  think  New  Zealand children should be forced to work as hard as Asian children do, but I think it is important for our children  to  realise  that  they  live  in  a  world  where  those  who  work  hard  will  end  up  with  higher incomes and more wealth than those who choose to work less hard. If we are only prepared to pay for beer, we won't be drinking a lot of champagne. The sooner we acknowledge that reality the better for all concerned. By not doing so, the risk is not only that private spending will constantly be running up against  income  constraints,  but  also  that  successive  governments  will  be  under  considerable  and unreasonable pressure to satisfy demands for increased public expenditure. Both  will  have  serious implications for our ability to finance development from our own savings.\n\n1 Indeed, over the period from the fourth quarter of 1992 to the second quarter of 1996 overall business sector productivity in the United States grew by only 0.3 percent per annum.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMr. Chairman, let me conclude by summarising my main points.\n\nFirst, I am confident that the new inflation target set me by Government is consistent with the legislation under which the Bank operates and consistent with monetary policy continuing to make the best contribution of which it is capable to New Zealand society and the development of the New Zealand economy.\n\nSecondly, whether the slightly wider target band enables the economy to operate with slightly less central bank activism depends heavily on how the change affects the expectations which people have of future inflation. If people assume that, on average, inflation will be 1 percent higher than they assumed previously, there is a real danger that, far from providing additional flexibility, the wider target will actually harm the way in which the economy works. Let it be clearly understood, therefore, that the Bank will be implementing monetary policy with the intention of having inflation as defined in my agreement with the Minister around the middle part of the 0 to 3 percent target. If we do this,  the  number  of  occasions  on  which  we  miss  the  target  should  be  minimised.  It  would clearly  be  very  damaging  if  the  impression  were  created  that  we  might  be  content  with  inflation outcomes near the top of the target.\n\nThirdly, we still have some work to do in convincing New Zealanders that our money is a predictably safe store of value for the relevant future. Until that is achieved, the interest rate at which the willingness to save in the form of financial assets is matched by the willingness to borrow will  continue  to  look  high  by  international  standards,  and  our  companies  will  continue  to  seek unrealistically high rates of return on investment projects. That will tend to mean that investment is lower than it might otherwise be, and that the exchange rate will be higher than otherwise.\n\nFourthly, it  is  important  that,  while  constantly  aspiring  to  improve  our  national growth  performance,  we  all  have  realistic  expectations  about  the  speed  at  which  the  New Zealand economy can actually grow. Recent reforms have undoubtedly increased our sustainable growth rate above that which was possible in the past: after several decades of growing much more slowly than other developed economies, we now seem capable of growth comparable to, and probably a little higher than, growth in many other mature economies, such as the United States and the United Kingdom. But we will probably never be able to equal the growth rates achieved recently by the 'catch-up economies', while growing faster than we currently can will depend  not  on  the  central  bank  being  a  little  more  tolerant  of  inflation  but  on  continuing improvement in many other policy areas and on sustained productivity growth.\n\nThe  Reserve  Bank  makes  its  greatest  contribution  to  New  Zealand  society  by achieving and maintaining public confidence  in  the  stability  of  the  unit  of  value,  predictably, dependably, reliably.\n\nBIS Review   23/1997",

Patrikis, at the Queen Mary &amp; Westfield College University of London &amp; UNISYS International Management Centre held in Saint Paul de Vence, France from 22-24/1/97.\n\n## A. Introduction\n\nI want to share with you today some observations and speculations gathered this and last year about banking and the Internet. I will be speaking in my capacity as a central banker --which includes monetary policy, banking services, bank supervision, and payments system oversight --and as a surfer of the 'Net. Let me state, at the outset, that, while the Federal Reserve Bank of New York does not conduct \"Internet banking\" as such, we do have a home page (http://www.ny.frb.org) with much useful information about our institution, with over three million recorded hits to date. Finally, let me add that some of what I say here today could, very easily, be obsolete in two months' or even two weeks' time. But I will try to point out those areas in advance.\n\nThe title of this portion of the program gives rise to two issues of definition. The first is \"What is the Internet?\" The second is \"What is banking?\" As I am sure you are well aware, in the United States we are a litigious sort. We even have a legal definition of the Internet. According to one recent case, the \"Internet\" is \"an international computer *supernetwork' of over 15,000 computer networks used by about 30 million individuals, corporations, organizations, and educational institutions worldwide.\"! Another case described the \"Internet\" as \"a global communications network linked principally by modems which transmit electronic data over telephone lines [with] approximately 20 million to 30 million users.\"\n\n\"Banking\" raises a host of issues in the United States. There is commercial banking and investment banking. The products offered by \"banking\" firms range from deposit taking (including payment services), investment advisory and management services, trading in financial instruments, brokering and underwriting financial instruments, lending, and trust services. A bank can offer all of these services on the Internet. For the purposes of this discussion, I will basically confine myself to deposit taking (including payment services) and lending.\n\n## A Central Banker's View\n\nFrom a United States central bank perspective, the most fundamental question of banking and the Internet is: What are the monetary-policy implications, especially were we to assume the enormous, widespread scale that some have been predicting? From this perspective, the answer appears to be: probably not much. If the Internet is used merely to facilitate existing banking and payment transactions, such as executing electronic bill payments or transferring funds from one bank account to another (which more or less describes what electronic bill payment really is anyway), the combination of banking and the Internet should have few, if any, implications for the conduct of United States monetary policy, or the measurement of the United States money supply. \"Money,\" as defined by M1, M2, or M3, would still be held in accounts at\n\n1 Panavision Int'l, L.P. v. Toeppen, 938 F. Supp. 616, 617 (C.D. Cal. 1996).\n\n2 In Systems, Inc. v. Instruction Set, Inc., 937 F. Supp. 161, 164 (D. Conn. 1996). The most comprehensive judicial description of the Internet can be found in American Civil Liberties Union v. Reno, 929 F. Supp. 824, 830-48 (E.D.P.A. 1996).\n\nbanks that would be reported to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System through the existing mechanisms that such funds are reported today.\n\nIf, however, Internet banking evolved to the point where digital \"coins,\" account-based cards and PCs, or other private-sector initiatives produced electronic representations of money that began to be used and circulated like currency, the potential implications for United States monetary policy are much greater. The key questions here are related to amount and velocity --that is, (1) how would digital bills or notes, or digital coins, be represented on the books of a bank or depository institution; and (2) how many times would this electronic coin or bill circulate in the general economy without somehow being processed and recorded by a bank? In this regard, the October 1996 Bank for International Settlements report \"Implications for Central Banks of the Development of Electronic Money\" states \"E-money could lead to shifts in the velocity of money which might temporarily reduce the usefulness of the monetary aggregates, especially narrower ones, for countries that rely on them as targets or indicators.\" In a June 1996 speech before a cyber-payments conference, Governor Edward Kelley of the Board of Governors stated that, with respect to a bank's liabilities incurred through issuing stored-value cards, such liabilities should be included in the statistical reports that banks must currently submit to the Board of Governors.3 It is difficult to argue that bank liabilities resulting from the issuance of electronic \"coins\" or electronic \"bills and notes\" should be reported any differently.\n\nA more problematic question arises when considering the matter of nonbank issuance of electronic coins or bills. Currently, the largest nonbank issuers of travelers checks are not required, but do volunteer to the Fed, the outstanding balances of their travelers checks, so that this information can be statistically recorded and reported in United States monetary aggregates by the Fed. If the issuance of private electronic money grows to a significant level in the real economy, and if much of that growth is provided by nonbank issuers of electronic money, there could be a similar request for nonbank issuers to provide information about the volume of their issuance and their outstanding electronic money liabilities, to the extent these liabilities are not recorded on the books of a bank every time they are circulated in the general economy.\n\n## A Bank Supervisor's View\n\nFrom this perspective, combining banking and the Internet offers both great opportunity and great potential risk. First, the good news --it is primarily cost-related. It has been reported by several banking studies that the cost of a typical transaction at a bank branch is now over $1.00; the cost of an ATM transaction is approximately $0.25. The cost of an Internet transaction, however, has been estimated at about a penny. I do not vouch for this statistic, but the difference is substantial. Such figures make a compelling argument for banks to get on the Internet sooner rather than later, and to move as many of their customers on to electronic or Internet banking as soon as they possibly can. Indeed, some banks offer low-fee accounts where the customer is not expected to enter an office physically --mail, phone, and ATM are sufficient.\n\nAs stated by Board of Governors Chairman Alan Greenspan: \"it is useful...to begin by reminding ourselves just why there is bank supervision and regulation. At bottom, of course, is the historical experience of the effects on the real economy of financial market\n\n3 Remarks of Edward W. Kelley, Jr., Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the Cyberpayments Conference '96 (June 18, 1996).\n\ndisruptions and bank failures, especially when the disruptions and failures spread beyond the initial impetus.\"4\n\nA bank supervisor should have concerns other than cost, and these comprise the bad news --the \"risk\" aspect of banking on the Internet. In the simplest terms, while we strive to ensure that banks remain efficient and cost-effective, we also have to ensure that banks know what they are getting into, and that they are capable of handling the risks that accompany banking on the Internet. The tension between the two is very constant and real, particularly because the technology today seems to be moving so much faster than bankers or bank supervisors can fully absorb.\n\nAt the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, we are being proactive in this area. We currently conduct on-site, information systems examinations of State member banks in our district --in addition to commercial, trust, trading, and compliance examinations --in which we try to review and constructively criticize the examined bank's entire MIS infrastructure. There is no separate, independent electronic or Internet bank exam as such. However, a part of the information systems examination reviews the bank's electronic and Internet activities and plans, and all examiners ask general questions that we feel that any bank offering on-line banking services should be able to answer responsively.\n\nIn addition, we have convened a special task force at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to review security issues involving on-line and Internet banking. The goal of this task force is two-fold: (1) to gather, review, and benchmark current and future on-line security procedures and policies of State member banks in our district; and (2) to then somehow disseminate, without unduly disadvantaging any specific depository institution that provided us with its information, the best of these policies and procedures into a kind of \"sound practices\" security guide for banks to use for their electronic and Internet banking services. The task force should issue its first report in the summer of 1997.\n\nIn a similar vein, I believe that the United States Federal bank supervisors, while mindful of the risks, have tried to be as supportive of electronic and Internet banking as possible. Each of the various bank supervisory agencies, i.e., the Board of Governors, the Office of Thrift Supervision (\"OTS\"), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\"), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\"), has dealt in some immediate way with the issues posed by electronic and Internet banking. Both the OTS and the Board of Governors have dealt directly with Internet banking through the bank applications approval process. In May of 1995, the OTS approved the application of a new thrift, the Security First Network Bank (\"SFNB\"), that sought explicitly to provide the majority of its electronic banking services over the Internet.&gt; In May of 1996, the Board of Governors approved the application of SFNB's parent, a bank holding company, for SFNB to acquire a data-processing firm specializing in data processing activities that would provide nationwide banking and financial services over the Internet.© In December of 1996, the Board of Governors approved the application of a Minnesota bank holding company and two foreign banks to join a consortium of 15 North\n\n4 Alan Greenspan, Banking in the Global Marketplace, address before the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan (Nov. 18, 1996).\n\n5 See OTS Order No. 95-88 (May 8, 1995).\n\n- 6 See Cardinal Bancshares, Inc., 82 Fed. Res. Bull. 674 (1996). In this Board Order, the Board stated that \"The Board believes the provision of computer banking services by SFNB to its customers in accordance with the authority granted by the OTS, and as specifically described in this proposal, is consistent with Cardinal's existing authority under the [Bank Holding Company Act] and Regulation Y to operate a savings association.\" Id. at n.1.\n\nAmerican banks and IBM to form Integrion Financial Network, LLC.7 Integrion itself has announced that it will not provide electronic or home banking services, but will instead design and operate a secure electronic gateway or interface system linking bank customers to their depository institutions, including links via the Internet.° Finally, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Board of Governors are currently processing an application from a foreign bank, with a United States securities brokerage subsidiary, to acquire a software firm planning to design software for customers of brokerage firms to place securities buy-and-sell orders over the Internet.? The OCC, meanwhile, confirmed in correspondence in August of 1996 that, in addition to providing home banking services to its customers through the Internet, a national bank subsidiary could also provide Internet access to customers and nonbank customers in the bank's service area. 10\n\nIn the midst of all this supervisory \"support,\" however, I should also mention some of the as-yet unsettled issues dealing with the unique regulatory burdens facing depository institutions offering financial services over the Internet. Among the most difficult will be the proper application of the Community Reinvestment Act (\"CRA\"), a United States statute that requires depository institutions to meet the credit needs of the communities where they accept deposits. What exactly is a deposit community in cyberspace? Nobody really knows. This has not yet become a significant issue because most depository institutions offering on-line services still have brick-and-mortar branches, on to which current definitions of a CRA community are based. Still, for exclusively on-line depository institutions, the CRA issue will become increasingly important as their market share grows. Some early discussions with the relevant compliance supervisors may be in order. I also note that this also raises interesting questions on the definition of the relevant geographic market in the analysis of bank mergers.\n\nFurthermore, considering the CRA issue brings forth another, broader issue: what is the role of nonbanks in the realm of Internet financial services, particularly payment services, which are still largely the province of banks and other regulated depository institutions? Because banks have been so intricately involved in the United States payments system, banks today face unique regulatory burdens: CRA, reserve requirements, deposit insurance premiums, and the costs of good supervision and good supervisors. If nonbanks begin to take significant market share away from banks because of an inherently lower cost structure, that raises real questions about a level playing field and whether or not banks can ever fairly compete. If nonbanks begin offering through the Internet many of the payment services, or alternatives to the payment services now offered exclusively by banks, that raises real concerns about the ultimate value of a bank charter, and what it really means to be a \"bank.\" Or is this \"banking\"? Another issue that may be relevant here is the implication of a firm that has a balance sheet that looks like that of a bank but does not have direct access to the lender-of-last resort.\n\nFinally, and especially in light of the issues just raised, I think it is important for me to emphasize that the bank supervisors have expressed a clear willingness to listen to what the banking community has had to say on the issues involving electronic and Internet banking. Regulation E, promulgated by the Board of Governors, implements the Electronic Funds Transfer Act of 1978, and establishes primarily for consumer protection purposes the basic\n\n7 See Royal Bank of Canada, et al., 83 Fed. Res. Bull. , (Order approved Dec. 2, 1996).\n\n8 Integrion also stated that it will not function as an Internet service provider, but will provide a secure electronic link to one.\n\nSee Notification to the Board of Governors Regarding Investment in Marketware International Inc. of Toronto Dominion Bank (Dec. 19, 1996).\n\n10 See OCC Interp. Letter No. 742 (Aug. 19, 1996).\n\nrights, liabilities, and responsibilities of consumers who use, and financial institutions who offer, retail electronic funds transfer services.!! Among the protections provided are required disclosures, error resolution procedures, and loss protection. In 1996, when the Board of Governors issued its proposed regulations concerning the applicability of Regulation E to stored-value cards, the Board of Governors explicitly requested that commenters to the proposed revisions indicate whether the commenters believed that part or all of Regulation E should apply to electronic \"money\" or \"value\" residing on a computer system or a personal-computer hard drive.\n\nSimilarly, the FDIC, while holding public hearings on its General Counsel Opinion No. 8 on stored-value cards and Federal deposit insurance coverage, !3 specifically requested additional commentary on Federal deposit insurance coverage and electronic value represented on computer systems or personal computers. I believe the message is clear: as bank supervisors, we are open to what the banking community has to say on this rapidly evolving market. New ideas and reasoned arguments are welcome. We must try not to restrain important new services developed by the banking industry but should remain vigilant as banking-type services are offered by nonbank institutions.\n\n## A Payments Systems Overseer's View\n\nFrom the perspective of a payments system overseer, I see much activity, but thus far, few genuinely revolutionary innovations with respect to banking and the Internet in the United States. Mainly, I see the application of faster, cheaper electronic processing of older, more established paper-based methods of transferring payments between parties. Credit card payments on the Internet are one example. Instead of using a telephone, a normal card reader, and a customer's signature, one leading Internet payments company has devised a secure method of allowing a bank customer to shop on-line with a credit card, by never releasing \"in the clear\" the customer's credit card number on the Internet itself. Instead, the company only releases the credit card number and a merchant's request for payment to the customer's issuing bank, away from the Internet, after verifying on-line with the customer that the purchase was authentically made. The bank processes the transaction as it would any other credit card purchase; the value added by the company is that the customer's credit card number is never on-line, a benefit indeed in today's security-poor Internet.\n\nIt is not hard to imagine that another step in this direction is for a third-party organization (perhaps even a bank subsidiary) to issue secure, encrypted electronic checks on the Internet on behalf of bank customers, or even unaffiliated parties, wishing to make purchases on-line. Much legal uncertainty remains in the United States about establishing such a process, however. Basic questions remain unanswered. What, exactly, would be an authorized signature on an electronic check? Put another way, what types of entities would be authorized to act as certification authorities on the Internet for such commercial conveniences as electronic purchase orders, electronic negotiable instruments, or their bases, digital signatures? Would these\n\n1 See 12 C.F.R. Part 205.\n\n12 I should note here that other consumer-protection regulations issued by the Board of Governors address consumer credit transactions.\n\n13 FDIC General Counsel Opinion No. 8 stated, in essence, that the FDIC would consider granting Federal deposit insurance coverage for electronic value residing on stored value cards issued by a bank, only if the value on the stored value card represented an obligation definitively linked to an existing bank customer's deposit account.\n\ncertification authorities be entirely private sector derived? Or would they be established and operated by the government, by the individual states, some of whom already have enacted digital signature statutes? What is the role of banks in this process? In particular, what are the risks to the bank, in allowing a nonaffiliated third party to act as a certifying authority for electronic checks drawn from the accounts of bank customers?\n\nI could ask some even more basic commercial law questions about banking in cyberspace. When is an Internet payment final? More specifically, when a payment over the Internet is made, has the maker of the payment made a provisional payment, as with writing a check, or a final payment, as with giving a certified check or making a wire transfer? Articles 3, 4 and 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code (\"UCC\") govern the above circumstances, but have nothing to say on Internet payments. Currently, private contract law governs; agreements between each of the parties in an on-line transaction should be very carefully drafted and reviewed. Still, if Internet banking and commercial transactions were to grow in volume and complexity, it is quite possible that private contract law could evolve into a specialized commercial law of cyberspace, and eventually be codified into parts of the UCC.\n\nOn a less theoretical note, I should mention that a multi-national Task Force on the Security of Electronic Money, established by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and the Group of Computer Experts of the Group of Ten Central Bank Governors, and chaired by Israel Sendrovic of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, issued a report on its findings entitled \"Security of Electronic Money\" in August 1996. This Task Force examined primarily consumer-oriented stored-value payment products by, among other activities, surveying the leading global suppliers of both card-based and software-based stored-value systems, and concluded that the technical security measures of these systems are being designed to achieve an adequate level of security relative to other forms of common retail payment, assuming they are implemented appropriately. I recommend the report to anyone interested in a general discussion about security issues and stored-value systems, Internet-based or not.\n\nMoving away from consumer banking and the Internet, and looking perhaps not-so-distantly into the future, I have also had occasion to question what the repercussions are for large-value payments transfer systems, such as Fedwire, with the emergence of a different, much more secure Internet. Generally speaking, the Internet today is a \"somewhat\" secure environment in which to conduct banking and financial service activity. The current level of security is not adequate for large-value payments. Some Internet-based payment products are becoming more secure, but only after the creators of these products have spent a great deal of time, effort and resources making their products secure. Consistent fast transmission and processing are also essential for large-value payments. The Internet today has no authorized, universal means of prioritizing specific electronic messages from other messages. Faster and better hardware helps, certainly, but offers no guarantee.\n\nOne of my responsibilities is to serve as the Product Director of the Wholesale Payments Product Office of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks. This includes the Fedwire transfer of funds, transfers of securities against payment, and net settlement. In providing these payment services, the Reserve Banks must charge a fee designed to cover their costs, plus what we refer to as a \"private sector adjustment factor,\" a proxy for the capital, taxes, and other costs incurred by private-sector service providers. Thus, I am keenly interested in the next stage of the Internet.\n\nIf messages sent across the Internet could be made timely, become much more secure at reasonable cost, and, if a widely-accepted prioritization scheme for electronic messages\n\ncould be implemented so that large-value payment messages could move instantaneously, it is not inconceivable that the effect on existing large-value payments transfer systems could be substantial. Within a five-to-ten year time frame, I could see at least a portion of Fedwire large-volume transfers of funds and securities --with real-time gross-settlement --handled over the Internet. Please do not ask me exactly when this will come about. On the other hand, with potentially enormous, secure, bilateral netting arrangements occurring between clearing banks in real time over the Internet, volume on existing large-value transfer systems could decrease dramatically. The clearing banks could, conceivably, save themselves some real money.\n\n## Jurisdictional Issues\n\nAny discussion of banking or any form of commerce over the Internet today would not be complete without at least a few words on the legal jurisdictional issues that the Internet presents. This is arguably the area of law most in flux, the most subject to change on a monthly or even daily basis, depending on the specific jurisdiction and long-arm statute under discussion. In the United States, cases have already been decided regarding court jurisdiction and the Internet over alleged trademark violations,!4 contract disputes,!5 and advertising disputes. 16 Although I am as yet unaware of any banking organizations that have become embroiled in litigation over jurisdictional issues from being on the Internet, I cannot promise you that such a suit will never occur. If a State banking agency or a State attorney general decided one day that a Web-site or an Internet-based transaction conferred sufficient minimum contacts with a state resident so that the state's long-arm statute applied to the bank, a suit could easily be filed. Minnesota Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III filed six lawsuits in 1995 against six companies accusing them of engaging in illegal business practices or running outright pyramid schemes over the Internet, although none of the six companies was based in Minnesota, and no Minnesota citizen ever came forward to complain about the companies. The fact that a Minnesota resident could have accessed the scams run by the companies, claimed Attorney General Humphrey, was sufficient to confer jurisdiction of his lawsuits in the Minnesota courts.\n\nLest this argument sound wildly and improbably expansive, it should be noted that the \"Internet access = jurisdiction\" idea has already been accepted by some of the Federal district courts that have decided such cases, although it must also be noted that these courts' decisions have been inconsistent, have all had slightly different facts, and have taken great pains to distinguish themselves from one another. New case law on the issue of jurisdiction conferred by Internet access is undoubtedly being made as we speak. At a minimum, then, banks offering services through the Internet should have signed contracts with electronic and Internet banking customers that specify to the courts where claims or disputes may be brought. Web-sites designed merely to advertise a bank's financial services should be designed to be as controversy-free as possible, although that may be difficult without making the sites content-free as well. Banks should err on the side of caution until the jurisdictional issues have had more time to sort themselves out.\n\nI would like to present a hypothetical fact situation to you which I think demonstrates some of the thorny legal and supervisory issues that could be raised by the existence of offshore banking entities doing business over the Internet with individuals in our\n\n14 See Panavision Intl, L.P. v.

I travel to the island of Atlantis, where I obtain a Class Z banking charter. I am permitted under this charter to engage in the business of banking every place in the world, except with residents of Atlantis. As you have probably suspected, Atlantis is founded on the principle of free and open markets, unfettered by supervision and regulation of banks with Class Z charters. Atlantis also provides for strict adherence of the principles of banking secrecy. My bank is named The Internet International Bank (\"IIB\"). The IIB offers a full spectrum of banking services to Atlantis nonresidents. Being a modern bank, it conducts business principally on the Internet. IIB has a series of quite attractive Internet pages where its products are offered. These pages spell out the products, deposit terms and interest rates, and loan terms and interest rates. All agreements are governed by the law of Atlantis. All deposits are deemed received over IIB's \"counters\" in Atlantis, and all loans are paid out of Atlantis. Atlantis has an enjoyable ambiance even exceeding that of Nice and Saint Paul de Vence; therefore, I see no need to leave the island. I do receive and entertain customers when they visit Atlantis. I do place telephone calls to customers who have responded to my Internet page, but I do not make cold calls to customers. Communications with customers over the Internet are state-of-the-art secure. Customers receive account statements over the Internet, issue payment instruments to IIB over the Internet, and request loans over the Internet. All payments to and from accounts are made by wire transfer to I[B's correspondent account maintained on the books of Atlantis Bank, the only bank chartered under Atlantis law authorized to engage in banking transactions with Atlantis residents. Customers may instruct IIB to make payments for their account. These too are consummated by means of payments out of IIB's account at Atlantis Bank. Loans are disbursed and paid the same way.\n\nThe question presented is whether IIB is violating the law of the countries in which its customers are located. While I have my own views as to the application of United States banking and securities laws to this fact situation, I prefer not to spell those out in my prepared remarks. Instead, we all might prosper by sharing our views as to the proper application of our home country's laws to individuals in our countries who might do business with IIB. I should note that this fact situation is a pure figment of my imagination. The cooperative efforts of bank supervisors over the world should be designed to ensure precisely against this sort of bank. In other words, like Atlantis, IIB should never surface above water.\n\nOur discussion should include responses to the following questions: (1) is IIB engaged in an impermissible activity in your home country; (2) if it is impermissible, what authority has responsibility for enforcing that law; (3) if impermissible, is that a civil or criminal violation; (4) if impermissible, is there any way for IIB to qualify to do business in your home country; and finally, (5) does your home-country court have jurisdiction to hear cases brought by a customer against IIB?\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo conclude, I simply wish to commend the banking and legal communities for learning as much about electronic and Internet banking as they can, now, and for trying to stay ahead of the curve of ever evolving and improving technology. I fully agree with the philosophy of letting the markets decide what will work and what will not. We, as supervisor and central banker, will try to stay out of the way as much as possible, unless because of criminal activities or systemic risk concerns we have to jump in. The private sector seems to have done fairly well so far. To this end, I point out a recent creation of the Banker's Roundtable, an organization composed of some of the largest United States banks, in organizing the Banking Industry Technology Secretariat (\"BITS\").\n\nBITS, as I understand it, is in the process of designing and implementing common technological standards for the inter-operability of systems linking banks and their customers, and is also hoping to act as a certification authority for its member banks for third-party system and software providers, to ensure that when an electronic or Internet banking transaction takes place, the bank's name is the only name the customer ever sees. Similarly, a certified software or systems provider would agree that the customer's payment information would stay with the bank and not the provider.\n\nI mention this not as an endorsement of BITS, but as an example of the type of innovation and cooperative or collaborative effort that can occur when the banking community realizes the enormous challenge and opportunity it has in the next few years. Central banks and bank supervisors must also be equal to these challenges. In order for us to fulfill our responsibilities, it will be necessary for the private sector financial institutions to keep educating and challenging us. It is those dynamics that will help ensure good public policy in banking supervision and regulation of banking transactions over the Internet.\n\nBIS Review 17/1997",

         "Mr. Meyer looks at the need to rationalize the structure of the financial services industry in the United States Remarks by Mr. Laurence H. Meyer, a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the 99th Assembly for Bank Directors, Southwestern Graduate School of Banking, Westin Regina Resort, Puerto Vallarta, Mexico on 24/1/97.\n\nMy topic this morning is financial modernization. Financial modernization today refers to legislative and regulatory reform to remove limitations on permissible activities for banking, securities, and other financial services firms. Financial modernization in the United States is sometimes used to refer specifically to the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act which limits banks' involvement in security underwriting and dealing. I will use a broader interpretation that includes, in addition, the revision of the Bank Holding Company Act to allow banks to engage in insurance and other financial activities, the establishment of a two-way street that allows banks to affiliate with securities and insurance firms and insurance and security firms to affiliate with banks, a rationalization of the regulatory framework for banks and other financial services firms appropriate to the expanded powers and structural reforms, and at least a careful consideration of a common charter for commercial banks and thrift institutions and the mixing of banking and commerce.\n\nThe financial services industry is moving in the direction of expanded activities and increased competition, with or without Congressional action, driven by market realities, financial innovations, technological change and global competition. Federal banking regulators are cooperating in this process, often reluctantly, but recognizing already existing erosions to regulations. Their ability to do so is often limited by statutory constraints, however, and, as a result, a clean and full rationalization of the structure of the financial services industry cannot be achieved without Congressional action. Nevertheless, what lies ahead is less a revolution than the completion of an ongoing process of financial market evolution.\n\nThere are important disagreements about the breadth of expanded activities appropriate in banking organizations, the costs and benefits of structural restrictions to protect banks from added risks, and the appropriate regulatory framework for the reformed financial services industry. Nonetheless, I believe that policy makers have come to the conclusion that, while their hand may be forced by events, there are significant benefits from expanding the permissible activities of banks and other financial services firms. These benefits include increased competition in the financial services industry, and increased efficiency and consumer convenience in the provision of financial services.\n\nAllowing securities firms to compete directly with banks and banks with securities firms and each to compete with insurance firms will clearly enhance competition in the financial services industry. Economic theory and historical experience suggest that competition lowers costs, increases pressure for innovation, and increases attentiveness to the needs and convenience of customers. Financial modernization would allow financial services firms to serve better the needs and convenience of their customers both by lowering the costs of financial services and by facilitating one-stop shopping. The Edge Act already permits U.S. banks to compete on more equal terms outside the U.S. by permitting the Federal Reserve to authorize U.S. banks to do abroad certain activities, e.g., securities underwriting and dealing, not authorized directly to U.S. banks in the U.S. Moreover, U.S. banks are consistently evaluated by foreigners as the most innovative in the world. Nonetheless, easing of regulations would enhance marginally the international competitiveness of U.S. banks. Financial modernization also promotes efficiency in the production of financial services by allowing increased diversification of income sources by\n\nfinancial services firms and by allowing such firms to take advantage of economies of scope, that is, efficiencies that arise from producing related products.\n\nThink of financial modernization as a puzzle involving domestic and foreign financial service providers and consumers, the permissible activities, the organizational structures, the safeguards, the regulators, the legislators, and the Administration. The Administration and the legislators, with input from the regulators, have to decide which activities go to which providers in what organizational structures subject to what safeguards, under the oversight of which regulators, all for the maximum benefit of consumers. It may not be quite as simple as it sounds!\n\nThe providers are the institutions whose future hangs in the balance: thrifts, banks, and nonbank financial services firms. Banks and thrifts may be combined and thrifts may therefore not survive as a separate entity. And, once the legislation is passed, affiliations may occur across commercial banks, investment banks, and insurance firms. In any case, only a subset of providers would be allowed to participate in this game. For example, only banking institutions that were found to be well capitalized and well managed and had adequate internal controls would be allowed to engage in the expanded activities. This is part of the trend to incentive-based regulation in which expanded activities and more streamlined regulation are confined to banking firms whose strength and performance suggest they can handle the increased risk.\n\nThe permissible activities include those that banks are currently allowed to engage in directly; the somewhat broader and evolving set of financial activities that bank holding companies have been allowed to engage in through their subsidiaries; additional activities that fill out the spectrum of financial activities; and finally, possibly, commercial activities.\n\nThe choices for organizational structures include a universal banking model, where all activities are conducted inside the bank; the operating subsidiary model, favored by the Comptroller of the Currency, in which some activities are restricted to operating subsidiaries of banks; and the bank holding company model, the traditional preference of the Board of Governors, in which some activities are restricted to subsidiaries of the bank holding company.\n\nSafeguards refer to prudential limitations on activities between the bank and its subsidiaries (and affiliates) in order to protect the public from conflicts of interest and other abuses, but primarily to limit the risks to the bank from the activities in the subsidiaries as well as to limit the transfer of the subsidy inherent in the safety net to bank subsidiaries and affiliates. The most widely enforced prudential limitations are those associated with sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act which limit financial transactions between a bank and its affiliates. Such transactions must be at arms-length and collateralized and, except for those collateralized by U.S. government securities, are subject to quantitative limits based on bank capital. In addition, banking regulators have sometimes imposed firewalls (including, for example, physical separation of banks and their affiliates and limitations on employee and director interlocks) to provide further protection and insulation of the bank from activities conducted by subsidiaries.\n\nThe regulators include the three federal banking agencies (OCC for national banks, the FDIC for state nonmember banks, and the Federal Reserve for state member banks and all bank holding companies), the OTS (the regulator of thrifts, other than credit unions), and the regulators of nonbank financial services activities (e.g., the SEC for securities and state insurance authorities for insurance).\n\nThe legislators include the members of the House and Senate, with special focus on the Senate and House Banking Committees where financial modernization legislation will be written. The Administration effort is led by Treasury.\n\nBefore I identify the key issues that have to be settled before the puzzle can be addressed, it will be useful to set the stage by explaining why banks are regulated. This will help motivate why bank activities have traditionally been restricted and why restrictions and prudential limitations are generally imposed when expanded activities are allowed in banking organizations. This will also help to motivate my subsequent discussion of the Board's views on expanded power and structural restrictions.\n\nTwo special characteristics of banking are critical to understanding why banks are regulated. First, banks have access to a government safety net through deposit insurance, the discount window, and payment system guarantees. Because deposit insurance can never be fully and accurately priced, it is necessary to monitor and sometimes to act to control bank risks in order to protect the potential call on taxpayers. The result is that banks are, in effect, subsidized by the government. This subsidy, in turn, creates incentives for banks to take more risk. That is, the safety net creates moral hazard incentives for risk-taking, because the safety net --and potentially taxpayers --may absorb most of the losses if the gamble fails. In effect, the incentive for the creditors of the bank to monitor banks' risk taking --the kind of monitoring that goes on for, say, finance companies --and the market pressures to have high capital to absorb losses are simply blunted for entities with access to the safety net. That monitoring and pressure for capital has been taken over by the grantor of the safety net: the government.\n\nThe second characteristic of banking is that banks --especially large ones --are capable of being the conduits of systemic risk and crisis in financial markets. A breakdown of the payments system or other contagion effect that hampers the ability of banks to intermediate credit flows could have serious consequences for the economy.\n\nThe challenge is to maintain sufficient regulation to protect taxpayers, avoid unnecessary extensions of the safety net, and mitigate moral hazard incentives without undermining the competitiveness of the banking industry and its ability to take risk.\n\nSome have suggested that the government safety net, instead of being a subsidy to banks, has become a weight around their neck in the form of burdensome regulation that makes it difficult for banks to compete successfully against less regulated financial services firms. A solution might therefore be to limit or even eliminate the government safety net or at least charge deposit premiums that better price the risks involved. But the safety net has effectively eradicated the threat of runs on banks, has become capitalized in the value of bank equity, and in any case is so politically popular as to be unassailable. Our point of departure is therefore to assume that the government safety net will remain in place and will not be priced high enough to make it moot. Indeed, none of the legislative reform proposals in Congress would alter the access of banks to the government safety net.\n\nThere will no doubt be continued efforts to reduce the net subsidy of the safety net. In addition to efforts to price insurance and access to central bank credit and the payments system more \"accurately,\" I anticipate that the government will continue other efforts. For example, I think the correct way to read prompt corrective action and high capital requirements is as an offset to safety net incentives that create moral hazards.\n\nMore generally, we can discern five regulatory approaches that traditionally have been employed to limit the extension of the subsidy, control moral hazard incentives, and limit the risk to the taxpayer associated with access by banks to the government safety net. First, banks can be required to hold enough capital in relation to risks so that moral hazard incentives are minimized. Second, supervision and examination of banks by their regulators can insure that banking organizations maintain effective internal controls and implement an effective risk management process so that the safety and soundness of banks is protected and the risk to taxpayers minimized. Third, banks can be restricted to activities that do not present undue risks. Fourth, banking organizations can be required to conduct their riskier activities outside the bank itself, so that the bank is insulated from those greater risks. Fifth, prudential limitations can be enforced to reduce the prospect that transactions between the banks and their affiliates housing riskier activities could threaten the safety and soundness of banks. Financial modernization represents a reconsideration of these regulatory approaches in the context of reform intended to reduce the segmentation of the financial services industry and increase competition.\n\nThe regulatory approach to maintaining the safety and soundness of banks has evolved over the period beginning from the banking and financial market reforms of the Great Depression era through today. From the 1930s through most of the 1970s, regulators focused on keeping the banking industry safe and sound by insulating banks from competition and limiting the activities in which they could compete. As a result, the financial services industry became highly segmented into separate entities providing commercial banking, investment banking, insurance services, etc.\n\nBy the late 1970s, the changed economic environment along with advances in technology, financial innovation, and globalization were presenting U.S. banks with increased competition from not only foreign banks, but from domestic thrifts, nondepository financial institutions, and the securities market as well. Banks responded by replacing lost business and lower margins with expanded off-balance sheet activities such as securitization, back-up lines of credit and guarantees, and derivatives. These responses helped banks to substitute fee and trading income for some of the interest income lost through competition with other financial intermediaries. Moreover, the larger banks generally sought expanded securities powers, so that they could stem the loss of customer business to capital markets. Regulators responded by reducing, in so far as they could under the law, the regulatory limits on banks and creating a more level playing field for banks and nonbanking firms. Financial modernization would further advance this process that has already blurred the distinction among financial services firms.\n\nNext the puzzle of powers, structures, and regulators must be solved. We need some guiding principles. The primary standard by which all modifications should be measured is the benefit to consumers of financial services. Would it make such services cheaper, more easily available, more convenient? Would it facilitate and foster innovation and competition? Modernization reforms that only increase provider profits --say, by eliminating outdated and costly regulation --are desirable, but only if, at a minimum, they do not reduce competition and consumer service.\n\nGiven that primary principle, a second standard is to rely, in so far as compatible with the other goals, on the market. Thus, within such constraints, the scope of financial activities of banking organizations should be decided by the organizations themselves. When the special nature of banking makes reliance on the market impossible, the regulator should try to simulate market responses. Prompt corrective action is an example.\n\nThird, we should not lose sight of the special characteristics of banking that dictate regulation. These continue to suggest that there must be appropriate capital requirements, structure, supervision, and examination in banking organizations.\n\nFourth, at the same time, the regulatory framework for financial services should be simplified and refined.\n\nIn resolving the key regulatory issues, we should address three questions: First, what expanded activities should banks be allowed to conduct? Second, what organizational restrictions, if any, should be imposed on these new activities? The task here is to balance the benefits from achieving potential synergies among related activities and efficiencies from diversification and economies of scope, on the one hand, with the need to protect the safety net, that is, the taxpayer, on the other. Third, what regulatory framework most appropriately accommodates expanded activities, while also adequately protecting the safety and soundness of banks, controlling systemic risk, and promoting effective monetary policy?\n\nI will outline the key issues each question raises, beginning in each case with the Board's position.\n\n## Activities\n\nThe discussion of expanded activities centers really on securities and insurance. I will therefore begin by setting out the current limitations on such activities in banking organizations, explain the Board's position on expanded powers, and then turn to unsettled substantive issues.\n\nThe Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 prohibits banks from underwriting or dealing in securities, with the exceptions of U.S. government and agency issues, and municipal general obligation bonds. Nonbank affiliates of Federal Reserve member banks are also prohibited from being \"principally engaged\" in underwriting or dealing in non-exempt securities. Since 1987, the Board has allowed member banks to conduct limited non-exempt securities activities through subsidiaries of a bank holding company, referred to as section 20 affiliates, because section 20 of Glass-Steagall prohibited affiliation on the \"principally engaged\" criterion. In the 1980s, the Board initially determined that an affiliate was not \"principally engaged\" in prohibited activities if no more than 5% of its revenues came from non-exempt sources. That limit was subsequently raised to 10%, and in December of 1996, the Board expanded the non-exempt revenue limit to 25%. Most major U.S. banks, I might add, have had experience in securities activities through their foreign affiliates. Most of these foreign activities, in turn, are conducted, subject to certain percentage and dollar limitations, through their Edge corporations, which are generally subsidiaries of the bank. By statute, Edge corporations are permitted to engage in activities abroad not permitted in the U.S. if necessary to compete on an equal basis with local rivals.\n\nThe Board has concluded that eligible securities activities, section 20 experience with ineligible securities, and activities through Edge corporations, have provided banks with considerable experience with securities activities. In addition, banks have been permitted to conduct private placements, provide discount and full service brokerage services, offer financial advisory services, and broker proprietary mutual funds. The repeal of the statutory limitation on securities activities by a bank affiliate would only extend an already significant presence of banks in securities activities and build upon a base of existing experience. In addition, it would provide increased competition without --by the record --increasing bank risks significantly. Moreover, the Glass-Steagall restrictions on securities activities were motivated by concern that abuses of such powers had contributed to the banking crises of the great Depression era. Subsequent\n\nresearch, however, has found that these concerns were greatly exaggerated and that there was no evidence that abuses in securities activities played a significant role in the banking crisis. As a result, there is little controversy about the merits of repeal of Glass Steagall.\n\nBank holding companies have been prohibited from insurance sales and underwriting since 1982, although existing activities were grandfathered. National banks located towns with a population of 5000 or less are allowed to serve as a general insurance agent. The Comptroller, supported by recent court decisions, has allowed such banks to engage in national sales from offices located in such towns. A number of states allow banks they charter to engage in insurance agency activities quite broadly. At the same time, the FDIC Improvement Act in 1991 prohibits state banks insured by the FDIC from engaging in underwriting insurance beyond the extent permitted for national banks. As a result, banks are gaining some experience in insurance agency activities, but have quite limited experience with insurance underwriting activities. Nonetheless, there is a growing consensus that selling all types of insurance and possibly underwriting life insurance would not present undue risks to banks and would benefit consumers.\n\nIt is important to note that securities and insurance activities are the only financial activities prohibited to banking organizations by statute. With the exceptions perhaps of property and casualty insurance, both activities seem to reflect manageable risks for banks. Consequently both activities would seem compatible with present organizational structures and prudential limitations. Indeed, the diversification of income sources might suggest that the extension of activities to include securities and insurance activities could, on balance, reduce the overall riskiness of the consolidated enterprise. However, commercial activities raise greater concerns.\n\nThink of a continuum of powers, including those currently permissible for banks and those under consideration with a ranking from low to greater risk. Where do securities underwriting and dealing and insurance agency and underwriting fall on this spectrum? While the answer may not be clear, I think that it is fair to argue that brokering, underwriting, and dealing in life insurance or securities are generally less risky than most of the credit risks banks have taken with their traditional lending activities. As we have seen in recent years with commercial real estate, energy, agricultural, and developing country loans, lending is hardly risk-free. Securities and insurance brokerage, in contrast, contain little risk, per se, and with their reliance on actuarial tables, life insurance underwriting activities would seem to present risks that banks could easily manage and control. Underwriting of casualty and property insurance, might, however, be beyond the higher end of the current risk spectrum.\n\nThe Board of Governors has supported both a repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act to permit banking organizations to underwrite and deal in securities and also a reform of the Bank Holding Company Act to permit banks broader powers regarding insurance brokerage and underwriting. The possible exception involves casualty and property underwriting, which the Board historically has felt raised concerns about risk.\n\nThe Board has not, however, supported affiliations between banking and commercial firms. While it does not object in principle to such affiliations, it has taken the position that it is perhaps best for banking organizations and their regulators to gain experience with new financial activities before considering broader combinations. The benefits simply appear less certain and the risks greater. The Board would therefore prefer to proceed with the expansion in financial services and to defer any discussion of commercial activities.\n\nAdmittedly, such an approach could complicate the modernization process, since some unitary thrifts and insurance firms are already affiliated with commercial firms. Would they\n\nneed to divest such activities, or could they be satisfactorily grandfathered if either the thrift and bank charters are combined or banks are permitted to affiliate with securities and insurance firms?\n\n## Organizational Structure\n\nThe Board's position has been that any meaningful expansion of new activities should take place in nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies. In contrast, the Comptroller of the Currency has proposed allowing such activities in subsidiaries of national banks. Some have viewed this difference as simply a battle over turf. The Federal Reserve supervises bank holding companies and would therefore expand its regulatory reach if new powers were forced into the BHC model. The OCC supervises national banks and would potentially expand its influence relative to the Federal Reserve if nonbank activities were permitted in operating subsidiaries of banks. But much more is at stake here than turf.\n\nThe location in the organizational structure of nonbanking activities raises fundamental questions about the safety net. Recall my earlier comments about the fundamental tension between risk-taking and market orientation, on the one hand, and the stabilization and moral hazard implications of the safety net, on the other. Such tensions focus, I submit, on the special benefits --the subsidy, if you will --that recipients of the safety net receive and the regulation that goes with it. We in the United States should be careful not to inadvertently extend the safety net --and, almost for certain, bank-like regulations --in the process of dealing with financial reform and organizational structure. This is a difficult issue, requiring balance and judgment, and I would hope that Congress would carefully review the options and their full implications.\n\n## Regulatory Framework\n\nCurrently, all bank holding companies are subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve; banks are regulated by state banking agencies, the OCC, the FDIC, and/or the Federal Reserve depending on their charter, and, for state banks, on their choice, and there is some functional regulation of specialized activities of holding company subsidiaries. Consolidated bank holding company supervision includes holding company capital requirements, examinations, and reporting requirements.\n\nTwo substantive issues are important as we consider the regulatory framework most appropriate for accommodating financial modernization. First, to what degree is consolidated supervision and regulation appropriate? Second, what role should the Federal Reserve have in regulating banks and financial conglomerates that include banks?\n\nBoth the operating subsidiary and bank holding company models facilitate functional regulation by putting specialized activities that might be subject to functional regulation into separate entities. For example, securities activities subject to SEC capital requirements and other regulations would be put into a separate subsidiary and similarly with insurance activities subject to regulation by state insurance departments. Under a pure functional regulation scheme, bank regulators would supervise only the bank, and there would be no consolidated supervision of the entire entity.\n\nThis appears, on the surface, clean and efficient, reflecting the benefits of specialization and division of labor among regulators. But it is completely out of step with emerging risk management practices at financial services firms and with norms for global banks and financial services firms around the world.\n\nBanking organizations are increasingly managing risks without regard to legal entities. For them to do otherwise would ignore the powerful concepts of portfolio theory and the gains they can achieve both from diversification and from managing risks on a consolidated basis. If financial services firms engage in consolidated risk management, regulators must insist on some measure of consolidated regulation that permits effective oversight of the consolidated entity.\n\nThe U.S. participates actively in world forums with regulators of banking and other financial services. There is a growing emphasis in these meetings on sharing information and clear recognition of the value of consolidated supervision.\n\nIf there is consolidated regulation, it could be carried out by the Federal Reserve, in line with the system's current role as regulator of bank holding companies. For example under Congressman Leach's bill, the Federal Reserve would be the umbrella regulator for the financial services holding companies that replace bank holding companies. An alternative model, however, might be for the regulator of the lead bank to be the umbrella regulator of the consolidated entity. That approach has the advantage of limiting the number of separate regulators of a given entity. It has the disadvantage, though, that the regulation of financial services holding companies would be disbursed among several agencies and that each agency could adopt different policies. A third model would have a single bank regulator for financial services holding companies whose predominant activity is banking and the SEC where the predominant activity involves securities.\n\nThe second issue is what role the Federal Reserve should have in banking regulation. You may recall that the Administration proposed in 1993 a consolidation of banking regulation that would have taken all regulatory, supervisory, and examination responsibilities away from the Federal Reserve and consolidated the current responsibilities of the OCC, and the supervisory and regulatory responsibilities of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve into a new federal banking commission.\n\nThe Federal Reserve opposed consolidated supervision and regulation and strongly asserted the importance of maintaining a hands-on supervisory role for the Federal Reserve. That role is especially critical for large, global banking organizations, but also for at least a cross section of smaller banks. The Federal Reserve believes that such an active supervisory role is essential for it to conduct monetary policy and prevent or manage financial crises most effectively. For example, the information examiners developed about the severity of the credit crunch in the early 1990s contributed to the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain an unusually stimulative monetary policy well into the current expansion. That policy, in turn, helped to support the economy while banking institutions were returning to health and reestablishing their ability to provide credit to support a healthy expansion. As the nation's central bank, the Federal Reserve also has critical responsibilities to prevent or resolve major problems in financial markets that cannot be adequately met without timely and in-depth knowledge of the operating practices, risk-management procedures, and financial exposures of the banking system.\n\nIn conclusion, the case for expanded financial activities for banks and other financial services firms is compelling. But it is important that differences in opinion about structural and prudential safeguards and the resulting regulatory framework be resolved, so that these disagreements do not block financial modernization efforts.",

         "Address by the Governor of the Bank of Italy, Dott. Antonio Fazio, at the Annual Meeting of AIOTE/ASSOBAT/ATIC/FOREX held in Milan on 25/1/97.",
         "Dott. Fazio examines the progress of the Italian economy in terms of stability and recovery Address by the Governor of the Bank of Italy, Dott. Antonio Fazio, at the Annual Meeting of AIOTE/ASSOBAT/ATIC/FOREX held in Milan on 25/1/97.\n\nYesterday the effective exchange rate of the lira was 5 per cent higher than in December 1994. Compared with the low point reached in the March 1995 currency crisis, the lira has appreciated by 25 per cent. To find a period in which the lira recovered to such an extent and so fast, it is necessary to go back fifty years to 1947.\n\nInflation, measured on the basis of the cost-of-living index, fell to less than 4 per cent on average in 1996; between June and December it was around 2 per cent on an annual basis. According to preliminary figures, inflation in January of this year was less than 2 per cent.\n\nThe net external position of the Bank of Italy, excluding gold reserves, improved from $28 billion at 31 December 1993 to $45 billion at the end of last year.\n\nIn 1994 purchases of foreign currency in the market, primarily in the first half of the year, amounted to $7 billion; in 1995 there were net sales totalling $7 billion. In 1996 purchases were renewed, at an accelerating pace from March onwards. Yesterday the foreign currency reserves of the Bank of Italy and the UIC amounted to $35 billion, after using $21 billion to repurchase official ecus and redeem foreign currency swaps and other short-term liabilities.\n\nForeign exchange interventions have been carried out in such a way as to avoid interrupting the appreciation of the lira. Between 1 March and 22 November 1996 the effective exchange rate rose by 4.7 per cent; the lire needed to buy one German mark decreased from 1,056 to 998.\n\nThe lira's re-entry in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on 25 November 1996 was at the central rate of 990 against the mark and 1,906 against the ecu. The new rate corresponds to a depreciation of 19 per cent compared with that obtaining before the September 1992 currency crisis.\n\nThe lira re-entered the ERM after the performance of the economy and an appropriate combination of policies had re-equilibrated Italy's external position, brought a sharp slowdown in inflation and improved the outlook for the public finances.\n\nThe surplus on the current account of Italy's balance of payments and the return to external equilibrium provide a solid foundation for the maintenance of the internal and external stability of the lira.\n\n## 1. The balance of payments\n\nThe actions to reduce the budget deficit, the new level of the exchange rate, wage moderation and the stabilisation of prices have produced a shift in the composition of demand since 1993 that has permitted growing surpluses on the external current account after a long series of deficits.\n\nThe surplus in 1996 is estimated to have been around 70 trillion lire, or 3.7 per cent of GDP. The surplus on goods and services was on the order of 90 trillion and in absolute terms was the largest recorded by the leading industrial countries. The increase of 18 trillion lire compared with 1995 was due to the improvement in the terms of trade, estimated at 4.7 percentage points.\n\nExports of goods and services, after rising in volume by 10 per cent on average in each of the three previous years, remained basically unchanged. Sales of goods and services to the other EU countries diminished-as a result of the weakness of demand, whereas exports to the emerging countries continued to increase at a good pace.\n\nThe share of Italian exports in world trade declined compared with the previous year, partly owing to a loss of competitiveness but mainly because of the unfavourable cyclical situation in Europe, where more than half of Italy's exports are directed.\n\nImports dropped by 2 per cent in volume, compared with increases of 9 per cent in both 1994 and 1995 and a decrease of 8 per cent in 1993; they were affected by the weakness of domestic demand for consumer and investment goods.\n\nThe competitiveness of Italian products has diminished compared with 1995, but still shows a large improvement on the period before the September 1992 currency crisis. Measured in terms of producer prices, the real exchange rate of the lira shows a gain of competitiveness of 10 per cent compared with the first half of 1992. In terms of labour costs, the gain is on the order of 18 per cent (Figure 1).\n\nThe marked appreciation of the lira in 1996 made a decisive contribution to the stabilisation of domestic costs and prices.\n\nThe effect of the good trade performance on the exchange rate and market interest rates was reinforced by that of the surplus on capital movements. Portfolio investment abroad continued regularly, generating an outflow of 53 trillion lire; foreign investment in Italy increased substantially to 122 trillion (Table 1).\n\n## 2. Italy's external position. The exchange rate of the lira\n\nAt the end of 1992 the country's net liabilities amounted to 11 per cent of GDP; at the end of 1996 the ratio was well below 4 per cent (Figure 2).\n\nThe current account surpluses that are forecast will bring the net external position roughly into balance by the end of this year and then make Italy a net creditor. Part of the item \"errors and omissions\" consists of capital outflows that are not recorded in the capital account; accordingly, the country's external position is almost certainly already in balance.\n\nIn September 1996 non-residents' holdings of Italian government securities denominated in lire and foreign currency totalled 350 trillion lire, as against 290 trillion at the end of 1995 and 100 trillion in December 1992.\n\nThis progression is evidence of foreign investors' growing interest in the Italian securities market, but it is also the result of a policy aimed at diversifying the sources of Treasury finance. It exposes the domestic market, albeit deep and efficient, and government funding to interest rate movements in international markets and to the evaluations and decisions of international investors.\n\nThe growing volume of public debt placed abroad is matched by the steady and substantial improvement in the external balance of the private sector. Starting from a net external debtor position of around 90 trillion lire at the end of 1992, by September of last year households and enterprises had built up a net creditor position of around 200 trillion (Table 2).\n\nThe 1992 currency crisis caught Italian households and enterprises severely off balance; the latter, in particular, had built up substantial foreign currency liabilities, trusting in the stability of the exchange rate, even though this confidence was at odds with the expectations implicit in the significantly lower cost of borrowing in foreign currency compared with that in lire.\n\nThe depreciation of the lira resulted in Italian firms incurring heavy losses. In the last few months of 1992 they began to reduce their foreign currency liabilities and build up their foreign currency assets and continued to do so on a major scale in the following years. The private sector's gross external liabilities, about three quarters of which consisted of borrowings by non-financial enterprises, remained virtually unchanged at around 450 trillion lire; their composition changed, however, as the foreign currency share fell sharply.\n\nOn the other hand, the external assets of enterprises, households and other nonbank operators rose from 370 trillion lire at the end of 1992 to 650 trillion in September 1996, with a significant increase in the proportion denominated in foreign currency.\n\nThe recovery of the lira began in the spring of 1995, partly in response to domestic agents' perception of the return to a balanced external position in foreign currency (Figure 3).\n\nCompared with a net external debtor position in foreign currency of 52 trillion lire in 1992, at the end of 1995 households and enterprises had already built up a net creditor position of 118 trillion. In September 1996 this had risen to 126 trillion (Table 3).\n\nIn 1996 a major contribution to the improvement in the exchange rate came from the net sales of foreign currency against lire by non-residents for portfolio investment purposes.\n\nIn the 1992 currency crisis the official reserves, acquired in connection with short-term capital inflows, proved evanescent in defending the exchange rate.\n\nThe central bank's foreign currency reserves are now part of an external position that is balanced overall and in surplus for the private sector.\n\nThe domestic savings accumulated in Italy over the years is now again equal to, and in prospect will exceed, the sum of the country's capital stock, created through public and private investment, and its huge public debt, contracted principally to finance the current spending of the public sector.\n\n## 3. The global market\n\nThe growing international integration of the Italian economy has profoundly affected the composition of financial assets and liabilities.\n\nThe share of foreign assets, which accounted for 9.7 per cent of internal sectors' total assets at the end of 1989, has risen in the nineties and was equal to 14 per cent at the end of the second quarter of 1996 (Table 4).\n\nThe proportion in Italy is now similar to that in France; in Germany it is higher, at around 20 per cent. Neither in these two countries nor in the other leading industrial countries has it changed significantly in the nineties.\n\nThe ratio of residents' foreign financial assets to GDP is around 50 per cent in Italy, 90 per cent in France and 80 per cent in Germany.\n\nThe diversification of Italian saving through investment abroad will continue in line with the development of the financial system.\n\nThe growth in Italy's foreign assets in the last few years has been accompanied by a rapid increase in its foreign liabilities.\n\nThe total financial assets of the leading industrial countries rose from 510 to 550 per cent of GDP between 1989 and 1994. Most saving and investment in these countries still has a domestic counterpart; the share of total financial assets with a foreign counterpart is around 10 per cent and equal to around 50 per cent of GDP (Table 5).\n\nThe total of the six leading countries' holdings of foreign bonds and shares is equal to some $4 trillion, or roughly one quarter of their GDP.\n\nInternational financial integration has led, especially in the nineties, to the emergence of a single, world market for currencies and securities linking all the leading national markets.\n\nIn this global market the pricing and trading of financial instruments are affected by the underlying performance of the international economy as a whole. The pattern appears to depend above all on the tendency prevailing among instruments denominated in dollars.\n\nThe influence exerted by US financial markets, and to an even greater extent by dollar-denominated instruments, predominates in the world economy.\n\nThe financial assets and liabilities of the United States, including those with both domestic and foreign counterparts, account for nearly 40 per cent of the corresponding totals for the six leading industrial countries. Japan's share is only slightly smaller, while Germany accounts for around 8 per cent of the total and Italy 4 per cent (Table 6).\n\nThe close links with the dollar of the currencies of Latin America and many of the emerging South-East Asian countries increase the importance of the US currency in determining the international financial cycle.\n\nThe correlation between the yields on medium and long-term securities across national markets appears to be close. Differentials tend to be larger during currency crises; when conditions are calmer and inflation rates converge, yields become more closely correlated and differentials smaller.\n\nThe yields on short-term assets are controlled by national monetary policies. In recent years there has been a notable reduction in the power of central banks to control longterm yields directly.\n\nSuperimposed on the underlying pattern of long-term rates in international markets there is a set of differentials that reflect the inflation expectations present in each country and the related medium-term expectations concerning the exchange rate.\n\nThe response of long-term yields to a change in official rates depends on the conditions in the economy, the economic policies in force and, in particular, on the stance and firmness of monetary policy.\n\nThe experience of the last few years in financially open economies with exchange rate flexibility between the major areas confirms the effectiveness of monetary policy in controlling inflation. This, in turn, exerts an influence on expectations and yield differentials, and thereby on the level of long-term interest rates.\n\nThe mechanism is well known in monetary theory. To the extent that monetary control is effective, it is able to influence inflation expectations and thereby interest rate differentials and hence the nominal yields on long-term securities.\n\nAt the beginning of 1995 we announced our intention of raising short-term rates with the aim of curbing, reversing, the increase in the very high yields on long-term securities (Figure 4).\n\nIn the currency crisis of spring 1995 the yield differential between long-term Italian and German securities widened to 660 basis points. The budget adjustment measures adopted, the performance of the external accounts and the improvement in inflation expectations caused the gap to narrow over the rest of the year (Figure 5).\n\nIn January of last year the yield differential with respect to Germany was still around 450 basis points; the more stable political climate and the further improvement in inflation expectations resulted in its narrowing to around 300 basis points at the end of May. The substantial budget adjustment announced in the autumn of last year, the approval of the Finance Law for 1997 and the further slowdown in inflation have reduced the differential to around 150 basis points.\n\nAs things stand today a reduction in official rates by a country's central bank is effective if it is ratification of more favourable inflation expectations. These, in turn, must be rooted in the performance of the public finances and costs. History shows many cases where the inconsistency of other policies with the objectives has resulted in longer-term rates rising instead of falling in the wake of an easing of monetary policy.\n\n## 4. Market participants and the allocation of funds in the international market\n\nThe growing openness of national financial systems has accelerated the development of the market for Eurocurrencies, especially that for cross-border deposits and loans. Institutional investors, banks and the other participants in the global market need liquid funds to carry out their financial transactions.\n\nDollar deposits outside the United States are equal to 70 per cent of the US money stock. The ratio for the mark is slightly lower at 63 per cent; for the pound sterling and the French franc it is 13 and 16 per cent respectively.\n\nFollowing the complete liberalisation of Italian short-term capital movements, in the spring of 1990 the Eurolira market also began to expand rapidly. It is now larger than the corresponding markets for the Swiss franc, the French franc and the pound sterling (Table 7).\n\nAt the end of the second quarter of 1996 the stock of Eurolire amounted to 340 trillion lire, or 30 per cent of the Italian money stock. London accounts for a major part of this market.\n\nThe mass of lire traded in the international financial market reflects a demand for financial transactions that focuses mainly on the secondary market for Italian government securities, though the demand for Eurolira bonds and derivatives is growing. The rapid expansion of this market and the size it has grown to, despite the reduction in yield differentials, are evidence of market participants' increased confidence in the lira.\n\nThe last few years have seen the activity of institutional investors in the global market grow at a rapid pace. At the end of 1995 such intermediaries in the United States, Europe, Asia and Oceania with balance sheets of at least $10 billion had total assets of $21 trillion (Figure 6).\n\nThese intermediated funds are equal to about one fifth of the estimated value of the six leading industrial countries' total financial assets with domestic and foreign counterparts, and equal to three times the GDP of the United States and twenty times that of Italy.\n\nInstitutional investors place the bulk of the funds they raise in their national markets; they are nonetheless of considerable importance in the international allocation of funds in view of how they make their investment choices and the scale of their investments.\n\nIn Italy, as in other leading countries, a large part of the funds invested abroad by enterprises and especially households is channelled through such intermediaries. They reallocate their resources according to the importance of the various economies, taking account of exchange rate expectations, yields and risks.\n\nThe proportion invested in each country is determined on the basis of portfolio optimisation criteria; the amounts involved are large enough to affect securities prices even in medium-sized financial markets\n\nAt the end of 1995 European institutional investors had raised $7.5 trillion. They are estimated to have invested 78 per cent of their resources, or $6 trillion, in shares and bonds. Around $2 trillion, or roughly a quarter of the total volume of intermediated funds, was invested outside the intermediary's home country (Figure 7).\n\nThe funds raised by US institutional investors amounted to $8 trillion at the same date and they had invested 80 per cent of the total in shares and bonds, a figure close to that for European institutional investors. In view of the depth and diversification of the US market, the greater part of these intermediaries' resources was invested in domestic securities; nonetheless, 11 per cent, or around $900 billion, was invested in shares and bonds in foreign markets.\n\nAlthough institutional investors in Asia and Oceania had also invested domestically most of the nearly $5 trillion of funds they had raised at the end of 1995, their international investments in shares and bonds are nonetheless estimated to have amounted to $400 billion.\n\nTaken together, these institutional investors held more than $15 trillion of domestic and foreign shares and bonds at the end of 1995, corresponding to around 35 per cent of the stocks of such instruments issued by the leading industrial countries.\n\nThese intermediaries' investments in shares and bonds issued outside their home countries exceeded $3 trillion.\n\nThe configuration of exchange rates and interest rates generated in international markets interacts with the financial variables of national markets In addition to the fundamentals of each economy, an important role is played by all the information permitting the assessment of the authorities' ability to implement policies aimed at achieving growth in conditions of stability.\n\n## 5. The 1995 currency crisis and the control of inflation\n\nIn the early months of 1995 the Mexican crisis and the weakening of the US dollar prompted substantial and sudden shifts of funds, out of the weaker currencies into those considered to be stronger. In addition to the US dollar, the Canadian dollar, the pound sterling, the Swedish krona and the Spanish peseta also weakened considerably. The lira was hit hard: between mid-February and mid-March it depreciated by 15 per cent.\n\nThe identification of a currency as weak or strong is linked to the general conditions in the economy, notably as regards the state of the public finances, the external position and the solidity of the country's institutions. In the background there are the stability of the currency's purchasing power, competitiveness, the outlook for economic growth and the availability of saving and the uses to which it is put.\n\nIn Italy wage moderation made it possible to avoid a cost-price spiral, but the increase in consumer prices and the depreciation of the lira caused a marked deterioration in expectations. Opinion surveys revealed that a surge in inflation was expected (Figure 8a).\n\nAt the same time as supplementary budget measures were adopted in February 1995, we raised the official discount rate and the rate on fixed-term advances; in May we raised them again.\n\nMonetary growth was drastically curbed.\n\nAt the General Meeting of the Bank's shareholders on 31 May 1995 we announced the objective of slowing inflation in the second half of the year; we pointed out that it was both possible and essential to reduce inflation to less than 4 per cent on average in 1996.\n\nTowards the middle of the year inflation expectations began to improve significantly (Figure 8a).\n\nMarket yields on government securities started to come down, especially for longer maturities; the lira strengthened, partly owing to the appreciation of the dollar.\n\nOn 31 May 1996, in addition to confirming that the conditions existed for inflation to fall below 4 per cent in 1996, we stated that it would be possible to achieve a more ambitious target in 1997: an inflation rate of less than 3 per cent.\n\nBetween May and December of last year the average monthly rate of inflation on an annual basis was close to 2 per cent.\n\nThe survey of consumer price expectations carried out last September indicated a rate of inflation of between 3 and 3.5 per cent in the first quarter of 1997. The survey carried out in December indicated a rate of between 2.5 and 3 per cent for the first half of this year (Figure 8a).\n\n## 6. The outlook\n\nAfter the breakdown of the gold exchange standard all countries' currencies became of a purely fiat nature. This is a new epoch in monetary history.\n\nInternational capital movements tend to expand, with a multiplication of money and credit at the global level that makes it increasingly difficult for authorities to exercise quantitative control.\n\nThe volume of funds traded, the rapidity with which they can be shifted and the sensitiveness of market participants to economic and metaeconomic information can generate tensions in financial markets and influence the quotations of currencies and securities, with significant effects on economic activity and prices, even in medium-sized economies.\n\nGreater monetary stability in Europe not only benefits individual economies but also contributes to the solidity of the international financial system.\n\nThe weakness of the economic cycle and the curbing of inflation have led to a fall in interest rates. Easier monetary conditions have been a major factor underlying the rise in bond and share prices.\n\nMonetary stability, public finances in order and flexible productive structures and factor markets are necessary to protect individual economies from destabilising speculative movements, to enable them to share in the benefits of the global market and economic and financial integration in Europe.\n\nThis is the context in which policies must be implemented to permit the full employment of all the available resources of labour, saving and physical capital.\n\nIn the last four years Italy has made significant progress in re equilibrating its external position, curbing the budget deficit and controlling inflation.\n\nIn 1996 the slowdown in inflation permitted a substantial fall in interest rates; the Treasury's spending on this item declined in absolute terms, despite the increase of 6 per cent in the stock of debt. The improvement in the budget deficit suffered a setback, however. The overall borrowing requirement grew in absolute terms and remained unchanged in relation to GDP at 7.4 per cent. The supplementary budget measures adopted in the middle of the year\n\nfailed to prevent a large overshoot on the order of 30 trillion lire compared with the original target set in September 1995.\n\nIn the Forecasting and Planning Report published last September the Government increased the 1997 budget adjustment to 62.5 trillion lire, compared with 37.5 trillion envisaged in the Economic and Financial Planning Document. This is a demanding commitment that is already having beneficial effects on government securities prices and the financial markets.\n\nAs I pointed out in my Parliamentary hearing on the Finance Law, the forecasts of the borrowing requirement in 1997 reflect highly favourable assessments concerning the primary surplus; these are only compensated for in part by the significantly better-than-forecast behaviour of interest rates.\n\nThe lower level of the primary surplus in 1996, with a shortfall of around 20 trillion lire compared with last September's estimates, will have repercussions on the results in 1997; these will also be affected by the cyclical slowdown that started at the beginning of 1996 and became more pronounced in the last part of the year.\n\nThe adjustment of the budget deficit will have to be pursued by curbing the growth in expenditure. On the revenue side it will be necessary to reduce tax avoidance and evasion. Further fiscal tightening would have adverse effects on domestic demand and prices.\n\nIn order to create confidence in a return to equilibrium in the medium term, budget adjustment measures will have to be of a structural nature.\n\nThere is an urgent need to revive growth.\n\nItaly, like many other leading European countries, is far from making full use of its resources of saving, labour and entrepreneurial ability, with consequent economic and social costs.\n\nIn cyclical terms the level of economic activity remains unsatisfactory.\n\nAccording to the latest forecasts, the growth in GDP in 1997 will be just over 1 per cent.\n\nThe trade surplus will remain large, as will the surplus on the current account of the balance of payments, thereby contributing to a further improvement in the country's external position and providing support for the lira.\n\nIt will be necessary to modify the composition of public expenditure, by reducing that on current account, in order to release the resources needed to return public investment to a normal level. In the last few years this component has fallen by around one percentage point of GDP. Investment will need to be directed to the areas and sectors where the shortfall in public infrastructure is greatest, to the benefit of productivity and, above all, of employment.\n\nThe latest reduction in official rates, following that enacted in 1996, was made possible by the improvement in both actual and expected inflation. Together with the ample availability of saving, it also creates the conditions for a higher level of private investment.\n\nThe fall in market interest rates will be locked in only if permanent price stability is achieved.\n\nMonetary stability, consolidation of the public finances and economic growth are three closely interrelated objectives. The experience of recent years shows that failing to achieve even one of them necessarily jeopardises the other two.\n\nThe establishment and maintenance of the virtuous circle is likely to be interrupted by the reappearance of inflationary pressures, which can be engendered by labour\n\ncosts, pricing policies that are short-sighted and unresponsive to competitive stimuli, by an insufficient reduction or excessive expansion of the budget deficit.\n\nMonetary policy will remain firmly directed towards producing an expansion of money and credit that will permit balanced growth of the economy in conditions of broadly stable prices.\n\nThe rise in the incomes of those already working must not hinder the creation of employment. A smaller absorption of saving by the public sector will make resources available for investment. These are the conditions for removing the most acute, most socially unacceptable, forms of unemployment, which have been aggravated by the events of the last few years. They will allow a host of young people with qualifications and a desire to contribute to the development of our economy and society to become active members of the labour force.\n\nBIS Review 15/1997\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (*) Quarterly data, partly estimated for the last two quarters.\n- (**) Quarterly averages, partly estimated for the last quarter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (*) End-1995 data for institutional investors with total assets of more than $10 billion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 7b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 7c\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (*) Partly estimated end-1995 data for institutional investors with total assets of more than $10 billion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BALANCE OF PAYMENTS\n\n(net flows in billions of lire)\n\n|                             |                                   | 1992    | 1993     | 1994     | 1995 |   | 1996 (*)   |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|----------|----------|----------|------------|\n| A.

The amounts under \"unallocated items and discrepancies\" include the statistical discrepancies between the two systems of accounts. The assets of the central bank and the liabilities of banks exclude foreign currency swaps. The assets and liabilities of banks exclude the components matched by domestic foreign currency positions, which are included directly in the figures for the State and private sectors.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                        | 1990                                          | 1991                                            | 1992                                              | 1993                                               | 1994                                                    | 1995                                                    | 1996 September (2)                                       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1.

         "Mr.  Bäckström  explains  why  price  stability  ought  to  be  a  central  bank's principle  monetary  policy  objective Address  by  the  Governor  of  the  Bank  of  Sweden, Mr. Urban Bäckström, at Handelsbanken seminar in London on 28/1/97.\n\nFor  most  central  banks  today  the  primary  monetary  policy  objective  is  price stability. The situation is thus very different from that which prevailed in the earlier period of high inflation.\n\nThe reorientation of monetary policy stems from people's growing awareness of an inflationary economy's harmful effects. The central banks, which are ultimately accountable to  their  countries'  citizens  and  the  latter's  representatives,  would  otherwise  not  have  been mandated to focus policy on price stability.\n\nIn Sweden, for example, 60 per cent of the population see 2 per cent inflation as an appropriate monetary policy objective and only 12 per cent are against this. In my country a low inflation policy therefore has broad political support.\n\nI  shall  be  talking  today  about  why  price  stability  ought  to  be  a  central  bank's principal monetary policy objective and what this means for economic growth, employment and unemployment.  From  there  I  shall  consider  development  in  Sweden,  the  framework  of  our monetary policy and the current situation.\n\n## Why price stability?\n\nWhy should price stability be singled out as a central bank's overriding objective? Why  not  attach  equal  importance  to  targets  for  growth,  employment  and  unemployment, particularly as these factors have high priority for economic policy in general?\n\nThe answer to these questions calls for an understanding of what monetary policy can and cannot do. In the long run monetary policy is only capable of influencing inflation; a systematically higher rate of inflation, however, would not lead to higher long-term growth. The level of long-term growth is determined instead by real economic factors such as demographic changes,  technology,  education  and  the  efficiency  of  markets.  In  so  far  as  a  long-term relationship  between  inflation  and  growth  does  exist,  most  of  the  evidence  suggests  that,  if anything,  higher  inflation  impairs  the  workings  of  the  economy  and  thereby  weakens  output. Today there is widespread - though not yet complete - agreement on this.\n\nWhat  monetary  policy  can  do,  on  the  other  hand,  is  influence  the  economy's fluctuations around the long-term trend, albeit without any lasting effects on growth. This means that if resource utilisation is low or high, monetary policy can be used to stimulate or dampen activity  temporarily,  but  not  to  fine-tune  the  economy.  With  an  inflation  target  which  applies downwards  as  well  as  upwards,  so  that  deflation  as  well  as  inflation  are  avoided,  monetary policy can then exercise a stabilising influence and help to smooth economic fluctuations around the long-term trend.\n\nProblems  arise  if  resource  utilisation  becomes  so  high  that  inflation  starts  to accelerate and the central bank has not intervened. People may then begin to count on inflation remaining high in the longer run. A higher level of inflation may then be established, whereas the  effects  on  production  and  employment  will  be  only  temporary.  This  is  a  reason  why  the central bank should act with foresight and be alert to the development of inflation expectations.\n\nThe potential for influencing fluctuations in activity around the trend is dependent on people's appraisal of the central bank's determination and ability to maintain price stability. Central  bankers  talk  of  the  importance  of  credibility,  by  which  is  meant  the  extent  to  which people  expect  inflation  to  be  in  line  with  its  targeted  rate.  The  degree  of  credibility  is conditioned by, for example, the historical record of inflation and the existence of government financial deficits. Weak credibility calls for caution in monetary policy, just as higher credibility confers more room in which to manoe uvre.\n\nExperience has shown, moreover, that even in the shorter run, the possibility of influencing  employment  and  unemployment  via  monetary  policy  is  very  limited.  Limited fluctuations  around  the  growth  trend  are  by  no  means  sufficient  condition  for  a  smooth development  of  employment  and  low  unemployment.  Comparisons  between  countries  and regions  reveal  that  a  similar  growth  pattern,  even  over  a  considerable  period,  can  involve markedly divergent effects on employment and unemployment. This highlights the function of the  labour  market.  It  is  there  that  measures  must  be  taken  in  order  to  tackle  problems  with employment and unemployment.\n\nI  want  to  underscore  some  conclusions  from  this  discussion.  Monetary  policy cannot have growth as the primary objective because it is not capable of influencing growth in the longer run. At the same time, monetary policy can be used to smooth fluctuations in activity around the growth trend. But I should emphasise that this presupposes that the central bank is committed  to  price  stability  and  that  its  policy  is  perceived  as  credible.  With  low  inflation, moreover, the economy will function more efficiently.\n\nIt  is  important,  I  believe,  to  realise  that  price  stability's  status  as  the  monetary policy  objective  does  not  imply  a  lower  priority  for  growth  and  employment  as  economic policy's  overall  objectives.  Rather  than  being  an  impediment,  low  inflation  creates  good conditions  for  growth.  In  order  for  this  to  be  combined  with  low  unemployment,  the  labour market must also function properly.\n\n## Monetary policy with an explicit inflation target\n\nSince  the  move  to  a  flexible  exchange  rate  in  the  autumn  of  1992,  monetary policy in Sweden has been conducted with an explicit inflation target. The Swedish target for the rate  of  inflation,  which  is  appraised  in  an  annual  perspective  and  expressed  in  terms  of  the consumer price index, is 2 per cent. The target is surrounded by a band of -1 percentage point, which serves among other things as a buffer for temporary effects on inflation. I should like to mention some factors which illustrate how the Riksbank works on the construction of monetary policy with an inflation target.\n\nAs monetary policy is characterised by long and variable lags, the policy needs to be forward-looking and based on an inflation forecast. In order to clarify our deliberations in the assessment  of  future  inflation,  the  Riksbank  presents  an  inflation  report  four  times  a  year.  A number  of  indicators  are  reviewed  in  these  reports,  together  with  an  assessment  of  future tendencies and a discussion of risks and opportunities in the field of inflation.\n\nSimplifying somewhat, an inflation forecast can be said to rest on two factors in particular: one is the relationship between supply and demand and the other is expected inflation . The difference between the actual level of demand and the potential level of production that can be combined with an unchanged rate of inflation is commonly referred to as the output gap . As\n\nthis gap is a notional variable, it is difficult to calculate exactly. We therefore use a variety of indicators to check for consistency of the assessments.\n\nThe  inflation  target  is  symmetrical;  that  is,  preventing  inflation  from  falling below the target is as important for  the  Riksbank  as  stopping  it  from  rising  above  the  target. Over time, the economy will then expand at its potential rate. The inflation targeting approach accordingly has a built-in control mechanism. If the monetary stance is unduly tight, bringing economic activity below the potential level, inflation will decrease and sooner or later fall short of  the  target;  and  vice  versa.  This  calls  for  a  calibration  of  the  output  gap,  a  new  inflation forecast and an adjustment of monetary policy.\n\nFactors that generate changes in ongoing rate of inflation must  be  distinguished from temporary effects on inflation due to once-and-for-all shifts in the price level. It is mainly variations in the output gap and in expected inflation which have an impact on the ongoing rate of inflation. Monetary policy accordingly focuses on these factors.\n\nTemporary effects on inflation may come, for example, from changes in indirect taxes  and  subsidies  or  from  shifts  in  terms  of  trade.  Monetary  policy  measures  as  such  may likewise  have  temporary  effects  on  inflation  via  changes  in  house  mortgage  costs,  which  are included in the measurement of consumer prices. This was the case in 1996, when the average rate of inflation fell below the lower band limit of 1 per cent mainly as a temporary consequence of the Riksbank's reduction of its instrumental rate. Clearly, monetary policy should not respond to temporary effects on inflation from upward or downward movements in the instrumental rate; to do so would be to make interest rate policy procyclical and thereby destabilising.\n\nThe monetary policy reaction to  other  temporary  effects  depends  essentially  on how these affect inflation expectations. If a temporary increase in the rate of inflation is taken, for  example,  to  indicate  a  more  lasting  upward  shift,  so  that  people  adjust  their  inflation expectations,  monetary  policy  would  have  to  respond  in  order  to  prevent  the  ongoing  rate  of inflation  from  increasing.  If  expectations  are  unaffected,  on  the  other  hand,  temporary  effects may be of secondary importance for monetary policy.\n\nWhere, then, does the exchange rate come in? Apart from its short-run effects via import prices, the exchange rate features in our inflation assessments in two respects. One is that exchange  rate  movements  affect  demand  in  the  internationally  oriented  sector  and  thereby  in time  the  development  of  the  output  gap  and  ultimately  inflation,  too.  The  other  is  the information  which the exchange rate may  provide about the development  of inflation expectations. While temporary exchange rate fluctuations hardly affect forecasts of inflation one to two years ahead, more lasting tendencies have an overall impact on demand and thereby on the output gap and consequently on the inflation forecast.\n\n## Adjustment after the inflation era\n\nSweden is one example of the numerous countries  that  in  the  1970s  and  1980s systematically aimed for higher growth and employment with the aid of expansionary economic policies,  with  less  regard  for  the  effects  on  long-term  price  stability.  The  outcome  was  very different from what had been intended. Compared with countries more devoted to stability, for example the Netherlands, Austria and Germany,  macroeconomic  development  in  Sweden  was poorer in many respects.\n\nInflation  in  Sweden  moved up substantially from the late 1960s onwards,  trend growth weakened and the period ended in the early 1990s with a dramatic fall in production, a sharp increase in unemployment and a serious crisis in the financial system.\n\nThe tendencies in the latter part of the 1980s were not sustainable. The levels of growth, employment and prices for real and financial assets could not be maintained. Partly for these reasons, Sweden experienced a profound crisis. Had the adjustment been made earlier and resulted in stability, perhaps the crisis would have been less painful.\n\nIn recent years, however, the process of adjustment in Sweden has come a long way. The economy is in the process of adjusting to the conditions that apply in a low inflation regime. This is being accompanied by an appreciable improvement in government finance, not least  as  a  result  of  the  extensive  consolidation  programme.  From  a  two-digit  level  just  a  few years ago, for 1996 it seems that the government deficit has been reduced to between 3 and 3.5 per cent of GDP. Moreover, the improvement is expected to continue.\n\nThat the consolidation of government finance proceeds successfully to the goal of balance  in  1998  is  of  the  utmost  importance  in  that  this  lays  a  foundation  for  balanced, sustainable growth. With the new, globalised capital market, the need for discipline in economic policy soon makes itself felt, particularly for a country that has had a difficult period of deficits and  has  therefore  become  more  dependent  on  domestic  and  foreign  creditors.  After  all  the experiences earlier in the 1990s, this is widely understood in Sweden.\n\nThe  resolution with which the consolidation is being achieved has  been questioned from time to time. However, the six-monthly control stations that are an integral part of  the  Swedish  consolidation  programme  have  made  -  and  continue  to  make  -  it  possible  for observers to monitor the political system's determination in this respect to achieve the goal of balance in 1998.\n\n## The current situation\n\nAt the beginning of 1996, favourable prospects for inflation prompted a monetary policy  realignment.  Continuously  falling  inflation  expectations,  accompanied  by  subdued demand, improved the outlook for inflation in 1996 and 1997. At the end of 1996 underlying rate of inflation was about 1.5 per cent. The twelve-month rate of headline inflation, which was actually negative for some months in the latter part of 1996, was affected by temporary factors, above all as a result of the Riksbank's interest rate cuts.\n\nThe  better  prospects  for  inflation  paved  the  way  for  a  notable  reduction  of  the repo rate during 1996, from 8.91 to 4.10 per cent, the latter being the lowest instrumental rate in Sweden  for  at  least  thirty  years.  Together  with  the  impact  of  the  exchange  rate,  the  overall monetary conditions are accordingly contributing to a continued recovery in the real economy.\n\nA shift in the composition of demand began in the course of 1996. But although the contribution to GDP growth from net exports decreased, the effect of foreign trade remains positive.  Private  consumption  is  continuing  to  rise  at  a  subdued  but  stable  rate  and  its composition seems to be shifting in  favour  of  durable  goods,  cars  in  particular.  There  are  no signs  that  in  the  coming  two  years  the  economy  will  exceed  the  level  of  potential  output  at which inflation is liable to pick up. The level of inflation expectations is also compatible with the inflation target.\n\nThe exchange rate has been weaker than assumed in the latest inflation report and the  current  level  of  the  effective  exchange  rate  does  not  mirror  fundamental  trends  in  the economy. This points to some future appreciation. Meanwhile, GDP growth in 1996 seems to have  been  somewhat  lower  than  the  Riksbank  counted  on,  which  implies  a  somewhat  larger output gap.\n\nAll in all, the picture of future inflation does not appear to have changed from the assessment in the December inflation report. The conclusion in that report - that monetary policy is relatively well balanced - therefore holds good. The Riksbank is continuing to evaluate effects of the interest rate cuts that were implemented during 1996, together with new information about real economic activity, inflation expectations and the exchange rate. This in turn will determine the future course of monetary policy, that is, whether the repo rate should be kept at its present level or whether there is any limited room for mano e uvre.",

         "Remarks by Ms. Susan M. Phillips, a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Seminar on Banking Soundness and Monetary Policy in a World of Global Capital Markets sponsored by the International Monetary Fund and held in Washington on 28/1/97.",
         "Ms. Phillips examines whether national financial market regulatory systems should be harmonised in the light of international competition Remarks by Ms. Susan M. Phillips, a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Seminar on Banking Soundness and Monetary Policy in a World of Global Capital Markets sponsored by the International Monetary Fund and held in Washington on 28/1/97.\n\nIt is a pleasure to be here today to discuss a topic that has become more important in a world of global financial markets -- the matter of coordinating and harmonizing our national regulatory  systems.  On  the  conference  agenda,  the  topic  was  phrased  as  a  question,  that  is, whether  we  should  harmonize  our  systems.  In  a  sense,  the  question  is  somewhat  moot  --  the globalization of the markets and the breadth of international conglomerate financial institutions is forcing us in that direction. But I would quickly add that one definition of 'harmony' is 'a pleasing  combination  of  elements.'  We  can  sing  compatible  and  pleasant-sounding  notes, without singing the same note. It is in that sense that I believe harmonization of our regulatory systems will develop.\n\nIn my comments this afternoon, I will mention some of the efforts underway in which the United States is working with other countries to develop more consistent supervisory and  regulatory  systems,  particularly  for  large  financial  conglomerates.  That  experience  may provide others with ideas about how they might pursue similar efforts, either on a bilateral or multilateral basis. Perhaps more importantly, though, I will also offer my views on where our interests are likely to be most similar and why and how regulators around the world are likely to continue  working  toward  compatible  or  'harmonized'  systems.  Let  me  begin  with  those thoughts.\n\n## The Importance of Compatible Regulatory Regimes\n\nOne cannot have dealt with U.S. and world financial markets during the past few decades without being thoroughly impressed with the rapid pace of change and the manner in which technology and financial innovation have affected market practice. The improvements in communications  and  transportation  and,  importantly,  the  gains  from  technology  and  the miniaturization of the goods we produce have fueled a growing volume of international trade. Our financial institutions,  in  turn,  have  sought  constantly  to  find  more  effective  and  efficient ways to facilitate and finance these activities, and at the same time manage the related risks. As a result, we have seen dramatic growth in financial derivatives, strong support within the industry for new clearinghouses and netting procedures to reduce counterparty credit risk, a growing need to clarify our laws and regulations regarding financial contracts, and financial markets that are far more closely linked today than they were even a decade ago.\n\nIn the area of bank regulation and supervision, substantial progress has been made in developing capital standards that help to ensure the financial strength of internationally active banks and that promote greater competition. Simply put, firms in need of international financial services  will  utilize  domestic  or  foreign  financial  institutions  to  the  extent  their  prices  are competitive and their financial stability can be assured. As a result, regulators are recognizing the need to harmonize laws and regulations in order to promote economic growth and to deal with important and oftentimes increasingly complex matters that are of common interest to us all.\n\nWe  are  recognizing  also  the  need  to  enhance  financial  systems  --  including supervision and regulation -- in the emerging market economies, primarily for the sake of those economies, themselves, but also because of their increasing importance in international financial\n\nmarkets. Indeed, G-7 leaders at their summit meeting in Lyon last summer identified this goal as an important element in efforts to promote international financial stability.\n\nThat we need some level of conformity seems, I'm sure, quite clear. Otherwise, the  inconsistency  and  incompatibility  of  rules  and  regulations  across  countries  may  make  it difficult, if not impossible, for some firms to engage in global business activities. Such barriers are detrimental to the efficiency of international trade and finance, generally.\n\nThe  difficulty,  of  course,  is  the  precise  nature  and  level  of  conformity  that  is necessary to maintain an efficient  and  equitable  world  financial  system.  Here  I  submit  that  it may be less important that we standardize particular banking laws and regulations, than it is for us to pursue similar goals, as we independently develop our domestic regulation and supervisory structures.  Specifically,  if  we  apply  market-based  incentives  in  our  regulatory  structures,  that, alone, should keep our rules sufficiently similar and compatible.\n\nWe must also recognize that technology and financial innovation are permitting banks today to become ever-more adept at avoiding regulatory barriers and other restrictions that artificially constrain their activities. Moreover, to the extent they are effective, such restrictions can work against local institutions, businesses, or consumers by making banks less competitive internationally or by withholding from their customers the benefits that competition can bring. Regulatory regimes are likely to be more effective in the long run for financial institutions and for domestic economic growth if they are market-compatible.\n\n## Areas of Common Interests\n\nIn  our  roles  as  central  bankers,  bank  supervisors,  and  regulators,  what  are  the areas  of  greatest  common  interest  to  us  for  which  we  should  develop  compatible  rules  and regulations? To keep it simple, let me suggest two. First, to maintain a healthy, responsive, and financially strong banking and financial system will facilitate the growing needs of our domestic economies. Second, to build and maintain an adequate legal and regulatory structure will permit our institutions  to  compete  safely  on  an  equal  and  nondiscriminatory  basis,  both  domestically and abroad. These thoughts may not sound original; they're not. They are essentially  the  two reasons the Basle Committee on Supervision exists, and they underpin most other international efforts to coordinate banking issues.\n\nWhen I consider the past successes in coordinating international bank supervisory or regulatory policies, I think first of the Bank for International Settlements and the work of the supervisors'  committee.  After  all,  the  BIS  has  been  the  principal  forum  for  developing international supervisory standards for banks in industrialized countries and, by their voluntary adoption,  for  banks  and  bank  supervisors  in  other  countries  throughout  the  world.  Bilateral discussions can also serve useful functions either where particular issues are of concern or as a basis for subsequent broader dissemination.\n\nNearly a decade ago, such bilateral and -- through the BIS -- multilateral efforts produced  the  risk-based  capital  standard,  known  as  the  Basle  Accord.  Since  then,  we  have produced numerous other policy statements dealing with sound risk management practices for banks.  These  statements  related  first  to  derivatives  activities  and  most  recently  involve  the management of interest rate risk. Dr. Padoa-Schioppa, chairman of the supervisors' committee, has probably already discussed these initiatives with you.\n\nOne of the Committee's most recent accomplishments, however, is the development  of  new  capital  standards  for  market  risk  in  trading  activities.  That  standard  is notable because it reflects a new approach for constructing international banking standards. In particular,  the  internal  models  approach  contained  within  that  standard  builds  on  leading industry practices and helps supervisors to promote risk management in banks.\n\nPromoting  sound  risk management  is  a  goal we  should  all  pursue  more aggressively in considering new banking policies and regulations. It is also the type of approach I  had  in  mind  when  I  said  earlier  that  our  laws  and  regulations  should  be  compatible  with underlying economics and market demands. To the extent we can continue building on 'best' or sound banking practices in designing  our  rules  and  regulations,  we  will  be  working  toward  a common end. As we work together identifying those practices and deciding how to apply them as supervisory or regulatory standards, we will also be strengthening relations among ourselves that can prove invaluable in times of market stress.\n\nNot to over-use the example of the market risk standard, but it illustrates another useful  point,  as  well.  Reliance  on  a  bank's  own  risk  measurement  and  modeling  process  in determining regulatory capital standards also acknowledges that no single or specific technique is best for everyone. Each institution should tailor its risk measurement and management process to its  own needs. While adhering to basic principles, each institution must determine for itself the proper incentives and techniques for managing its affairs. No two banks or banking markets are  identical  in  their  operations,  structure,  or  historical  development.  Permitting  a  range  of compatible responses to similar situations encourages experimentation, innovation, and growth. Accommodating  a  certain  level  of  flexibility  is  necessary  for  banks,  and  it  is  necessary  for regulators, too.\n\nIndeed, flexibility may be even more important for non-G-10 countries than it is for those of us with large, developed financial systems because of the greater range of capital market and economic infrastructures among developing countries. Materially different situations typically  require  different  solutions.  Accommodating  differences,  though,  does  not  reduce  the need  for  minimum  regulatory  or  supervisory  standards  based  upon  well-known  principles  of sound banking. It is up to supervisors and, if necessary, legislators to craft regulations and laws consistent  with  internationally  recognized  standards,  but  accommodative  to  local  customs  and economic needs.\n\nIn  developing  sufficiently  flexible,  market-compatible  regulations,  I  believe  we should rely as much as prudently possible on market discipline and on banks' internal incentives to  perform  well.  This  approach  requires  that  the  public  have  information  about  the  risk exposures of banks and about their procedures for managing those risks. As regulators, we can encourage this process by requiring or  prodding  banks  to  disclose  information  to  the  markets that is both relevant and comparable among institutions.\n\nWhether such disclosures are imposed by official regulations or evolve  through more subtle efforts, supervisors can help guide the process by considering carefully the kinds of information the private sector needs and that banks use -- or should use -- to manage risk. Even in  the  United  States,  where  surveys  show  disclosure  is  relatively  good,  supervisors  make available to the public data collected on Call Reports.\n\nIn countries where disclosure practices are minimal at best, bank regulators may be able to perform a particularly important role by publicly disclosing some, if not much, of the information banks report to them. By fueling  market  information  in  this  way,  regulators  may\n\nstimulate  greater  investor  interest  in  banks  and  the  growth  of  local  capital  markets.  Improved disclosure practices by banks may, in turn, also spill over to other industries. One thing we know for sure is that investors dislike uncertainty. By shedding light on a bank's condition and future prospects, some of that uncertainty should disappear.\n\nWhile  it  is  important  that  key  prudential  standards  be  sufficiently  robust  and consistent among countries, certain variations in the details and applications of these standards can  be  useful.  As  with  private  markets,  some  level  of  competition  among  regulators  can stimulate  improvements  and  change.  I  will  grant  that  the  United  States  may  take  regulatory competition to an extreme, but it also demonstrates, I believe, the advantages that derive from accommodating  different  views  and  permitting  financial  institutions  alternative  ways  to  do business. In my view, and considering the political difficulties we have faced in trying to change U.S.  banking  laws,  our  current  regulatory  structure,  offering  some  choice  in  charter  that  is administered by multiple regulators, has provided financial institutions with more freedom and expanded powers than they would likely have received with a single regulator.\n\nSupervisors  must  be  careful,  however,  as  they  try  new  or  different  techniques, that  they  do  not  impair  their  oversight  efforts  or  relax  them  beyond  prudent  bounds.  In  such global  markets  as  we  have  today,  weak  or  ineffective  supervision  in  either  large  or  small countries can have far reaching consequences. Those concerns were at the heart of early work of the Basle Committee and its efforts to identify the respective roles and responsibilities of home and host authorities for internationally active banks. It is important for supervisors to be able to rely  on  their  counterparts  in  other  countries  to  administer  agreed-upon  standards  of  financial institution safety and soundness.\n\nWhether we conduct our own on-site examinations, rely on external auditors, or use combinations of other supervisory techniques, we need to assure ourselves that all banking offices are adequately managed and supervised. I would note here that among G-10 countries a more consistent approach may begin to emerge. We in the United States are making greater use of  the  findings  of  a  bank's  internal  and  external  auditors  to  guide  or  supplement  our  on-site examinations, while some of our counterparts abroad are recognizing more the benefits of onsite exams.\n\n## Financial Conglomerates\n\nSome of the greatest challenges to bank supervisors may arise when organizations link banking activities with other financial or nonfinancial businesses. Such financial conglomerates,  which  often  combine  banking,  insurance,  and  securities  activities,  are  not currently allowed to provide a full array of financial services in the United States, but they may do so abroad.\n\nThe existence of such firms -- and the fact that some of them are headquartered in this  country  --  have  required  regulators  and  supervisors  in  the  United  States  to  work  with counterparts abroad to discuss oversight arrangements and develop ways to deal with matters in times of crises. This very issue is one of our current challenges. I have to say that this is not a particularly quick or easy process and is further complicated by the diverse regulatory structures, both here and abroad, involving banking, securities, and sometimes insurance regulators.\n\nThese discussions often raise difficult issues, since they tend to break new ground in  supervision.  For  example,  what  approach  should  be  taken  regarding  nonbank  --  or  even nonfinancial -- activities of companies that own banks? In the context of these conglomerates,\n\nwhat  does  or  should  'consolidated  supervision'  mean?  Within  the  context  of  consolidated supervision, how can the traditional safety-and-soundness approach used by bank supervisors be reconciled  with  the  disclosure/self-regulatory  approach  used  by  many  securities  regulators? Moreover, do the diverse operating structures of conglomerates imply an extension of the safety net that virtually all governments currently extend to banks? One thing is clear: as we address the  challenges  of  promoting  a  more  consistent  bank  supervisory  and  regulatory  process worldwide, we cannot always take official descriptions of regulatory and oversight regimes at face value. We need to dig deeper to understand how laws are interpreted and how individual banking agencies monitor and enforce safe banking.\n\nDifferent countries necessarily have different banking and financial systems that face  unique  combinations of exposures and business risks.  Even  within  the  United  States,  for example,  we  have  a  relatively  uniform  supervisory  approach  for  all  banks  and  a  risk-based capital standard that applies to them all. In practice, however, the activities of our banks, their capital levels, and their operating practices are quite diverse, and our oversight efforts take those differences  into  account.  Small  banks,  themselves,  recognize  the  greater  risks  they  face  from their lack of size and diversity, and  have  consistently  maintained  higher  capital  ratios  than  do money center  banks.  But  they  also  have  less  formal  procedures  and  internal  controls,  simply because their staffing and operations are so much smaller. The point is that even a uniform set of rules within a given country can and should be implemented differently as conditions demand.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt seems clear that as financial markets become more and more integrated, bank regulators around the world will be seeing more of each other than they have in the past. Even in countries that have no internationally active domestic banks, authorities need to ensure that the banks  operating  in  their  markets  are  sound  and  subject  to  adequate  supervision,  whether  by home or host authorities. Banks operating imprudently and without proper supervision are the ones  most  likely  to  mismeasure  their  risks,  misprice  their  products,  and  disrupt  the  markets. Detecting  and  deterring  such  institutions  does  not  require  us  to  have  uniform  regulatory  or supervisory systems, but it does require a certain level of cooperation and coordination  and  a material  level  of  consistency  in  our  regulatory  regimes.  Our  experience  in  the  United  States suggests  that  achieving  an  appropriate  convergence  takes  time,  not  only  to  develop  but  to maintain.  Progress  we  have  seen  through  the  European  Union  and  the  BIS  goes  far  in coordinating, or harmonizing, banking laws, regulations, and operating standards, but that's just a  start.  As  managers  of  large  financial  institutions  develop  more  sophisticated  and  more comprehensive risk management systems, they are paying less attention every day to the peculiar legal  structure  of  their  organizations.  As  regulators,  we  need  to  understand  how  banking organizations  manage  and  control  risks  and  the  full  implications  of  their  practices  for  the financial  safety  of  depository  institutions.  By  doing  so,  we  can  do  much  to  protect  our  own interests while still recognizing and accommodating the business needs of banks.\n\nIn developing our laws and regulations we need to work together, for sure. But perhaps more importantly, we need to understand the market forces and incentives that banks face.  If  we  keep  those  factors  in  mind  in  developing  our  individual  rules,  we  may  go  far  in developing regulatory systems that are both compatible among countries and less intrusive to the institutions we oversee.",

         "Mr. Heikensten discusses inflation and the interest rate in Sweden  (Central Bank Articles and Speeches, 29 Jan 97)",
         "Address by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr. Lars Heikensten, at a conference arranged by the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce and Veckans Affärer on 29/1/97.",
         "Mr. Heikensten discusses inflation and the interest rate in Sweden Address by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr. Lars Heikensten, at a conference arranged by the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce and Veckans Affarer on 29/1/97.\n\nI should like to begin with a word of thanks for the invitation to talk about economic developments, inflation and the conditions for monetary policy. It is beginning to have the feel of a tradition.\n\nToday I shall start by considering the course of events since we met here a year ago. Then I intend to take a look at the future and paint a picture of the outlook not just for 1997 but for the somewhat longer perspective that is relevant for monetary policy. Finally I shall draw some policy conclusions.\n\n## Growth but not employment\n\nBefore considering 1996, however, I shall look further back. Since the summer of 1993, when the dramatic fall in production was broken, the annual growth rate in the Swedish economy has averaged about 2.8 per cent. This is considerably higher than the rates we were accustomed to in the 1970s and 1980s. In that capacity utilisation was so low initially, it is hardly surprising that growth as such has been high. What is surprising -and very troublesome -is the weak development of employment.\n\nSweden is not alone in Europe in having problems with the creation of new jobs; rather the reverse. But in the United States the situation is very different and even in Europe there are exceptions; one is Holland in the past decade (Diagram 1). The differences from Sweden are appreciable.\n\nToday in Sweden the issue of unemployment is being discussed more and more. It is important that the premises for this discussion are correct. At the Riksbank we believe that in the coming two years production in Sweden will pick up again, although growth is unlikely to reach the average level of the past three to four years. This should generate some increase in employment. But a radical improvement in employment calls for more than economic growth; above all it requires that the labour market and wage formation function better.\n\n## Markedly lower interest rates\n\nWhen I spoke at this conference a year ago the repo rate was 8.66 per cent. In the course of 1996 we lowered the rate 25 times. At the end of 1996 the repo rate was 4.10 per cent as against 8.91 per cent at the beginning. In the industrialised world, the Riksbank's reduction of its instrumental rate is accordingly one of the largest and steepest. Moreover, the current level of the repo rate is the lowest in Sweden for more than thirty years.\n\nThe cuts have been gradual and as far as possible predictable. As the outlook for inflation improved and interest rates declined, market perceptions of how far down the repo rate might move were also revised (Diagram 2). Our intention was to bring the repo rate down without any loss of confidence in monetary policy, as expressed in such price variables as the exchange rate and long bond rates. It worked; at no time did the market react so wildly as to disturb the picture.\n\nThere are good reasons for underscoring that such a monetary policy realignment presupposes that many factors are favourable. That was the case in 1996. The conditions in international financial markets were stable and positive for Sweden. Economic activity abroad and in Sweden was comparatively weak and implied a good outlook for inflation. Sweden's fiscal policy was perceived as increasingly credible as the budget outcome improved and both the Government and the Riksdag (Sweden's parliament) demonstrated a determination to fulfil earlier commitments.\n\n## Better outlook for inflation\n\nIn Sweden the outlook for inflation improved on several counts:\n\n-Economic activity became somewhat weaker. Export growth slackened as a result of the krona's appreciation and slowdowns abroad. This was accompanied by a reduction of industrial stocks. The domestic economy was relatively weak, though activity does seem to have picked up, particularly last autumn. GDP growth probably amounted to between 1 and 1.5 per cent (Diagram 3). In terms of long-term balance, the composition of growth was favourable, with strong increases for net exports and industrial investment (Diagram 4). There was also a large surplus on current account.\n\n-The inflation propensity seems to have decreased. The conditions for persistently low inflation improved in a number of respects. The expected rate of inflation fell from survey to survey (Diagram 5). Bond pricing shows a similar picture. Most of the surveyed groups now expect a rate of inflation, even in the longer run, that is well in line with the Riksbank's target. In parts of the economy it also looks as though pricing behaviour has changed; conceivable explanations for this include increased competition as a result of deregulations and EU membership. These tendencies are difficult to confirm for certain but the indications are clear.\n\n-Temporary effects have also been at work. The krona's appreciation accounted for approximately 0.4 percentage points of the fall in inflation from 2.6 per cent in December 1995 to -0.2 per cent in December 1996. For the CPI, the part played by decreased interest rates has been even greater; the downward effect on the inflation from falling house mortgage rates totalled 1.4 percentage points. It is because of the temporary effects that the average level of the inflation in 1996 is outside the Riksbank's target interval. As a rule, the interval surrounding the target figure should suffice to absorb changes of this type in the composition of inflation. That this was not the case in 1996 had to do with the marked reappraisal of the situation in Sweden. Both the rate of inflation generated domestically and the ways in which the Riksbank measures underlying inflation show a fall that is less dramatic (Diagram 6).\n\n## Improvement in government finance\n\nPerhaps the most pronounced swing in the past year (actually since the summer of 1995) has occurred for government finance. Confidence grew in the ability of the Government and the Riksdag to reverse the crisis. A number of factors contributed to this.\n\n-The budget outcome successively improved in relation to earlier official estimates (Diagram 7). As regards the budget deficit for 1997, current estimates suggest that\n\nSweden will do well in a European context. And although Government debt is still high, here, too, the turn seems to be more distinct than expected.\n\n-Another factor behind the swing is the Government's clear adherence to the convergence programme from the summer of 1995. When it seemed that the budget target was in danger in the spring of 1996, additional measures were presented to fulfil the ambitions. This had favourable effects on interest rates and credibility.\n\nDevelopments in recent years prompt two distinct warnings. Building up the credibility which characterised the past year took a long time and was very costly. The announcement of extensive measures in the winter of 1994-95 did not suffice. It was not until the budget outcome started to turn that we could reap the positive effects on bond rates, etc. It must also be borne in mind that a part of the budget's reinforcement is tied to the stronger exchange rate and the lower interest rates. Sustained confidence is therefore a sine qua non for budget consolidation.\n\nIn view of the political debate, there may be cause to underscore fiscal policy's importance for monetary policy. A tighter fiscal policy normally implies a better situation for inflation; it makes it easier for the Riksbank to fulfil the inflation target in conjunction with low interest rates. In addition, a fiscal policy that lacks credibility creates problems for monetary policy -as was the case during much of the period 1990-95. The radical lowering of interest rates during 1996 is something for which our thanks are very much due to fiscal policy.\n\n## Continued economic upswing\n\nSo much for history. In discussing tendencies for the coming years I shall start from our inflation report last December.\n\nIn the report, conditions for exports in the coming years were judged to be good. Nothing has occurred to modify that assessment. Industry's competitive position is favourable. To an increasing extent, export growth seems to be coming from rapidly expanding regions, not least Asia. The international upswing last autumn is expected to become somewhat stronger in both 1997 and 1998.\n\nJudging from order inflows and other business tendency figures, the growth of exports is likely to be modest. The most recent figures may perhaps indicate that international developments will generate somewhat weaker growth than expected, but the difference would be marginal. This is countered, moreover, by an exchange rate that, at present at least, is weaker.\n\nThe conditions for increased demand for consumption were also judged to be favourable (Diagram 8). Neither has the picture in this respect changed at all substantially. Increased consumption is indicated by low interest rates and a level of household saving that, historically, is relatively high and is expected to show some fall. To this can be added an accumulated need to renew the stock of durable goods. The main factor in the opposite direction is unemployment, which is persistently high and even tended to rise in the autumn. Neither are the increments to household income in the period 1997-98 expected to be as large as in 1996. Then there is the uncertainty that stems from weak government finance and the changes that have been made and may be called for in the social security system, including pensions. All in all, however, it seems that the subdued but stable increase in consumption may continue.\n\nIn view of the above, we adhere to the growth scenario that featured in the last two inflation reports. This implies an accelerating growth rate that for 1996 and 1997 combined totals almost 4 per cent. Development in 1996, however, seems to have been marginally weaker than we counted on. Some further acceleration of growth is then foreseen in 1998. The conclusion in the inflation report therefore holds good: it is not likely that in the coming two years economic activity will rise above the level of potential output at which inflation is liable to pick up (Diagram 9).\n\n## Wage development a key factor\n\nThe wage increases during 1996 exceeded what the Swedish economy can manage in the longer run. The underlying rate of wage increases moved up to more than 5 per cent. The rate of wage increases on top of collective agreements also accelerated in manufacturing.\n\nFor price formation in 1996, the consequences of these tendencies were limited. As long as domestic demand remains subdued, firms have difficulty in passing through the increased wage costs to prices. The outcome is more likely to be rationalisation, increased productivity and, in certain cases, decreased employment.\n\nThe starting point for the Riksbank's assessment of the future rate of wage increases is that a downward adjustment will be achieved. At the time of the settlements that were reached in much of the labour market in 1994-95 the expected level of future inflation was considerably higher than it is today (Diagram 10). The present credibility of the inflation target did not exist. Moreover, employment was rising relatively fast in parts of the economy and profits were higher than they are today.\n\nThe downward adjustment we foresee is, however, a gradual process and slower than would be desirable. As far as inflation in the next two years is concerned, the slow adjustment is not seen as a problem, at least as long as the situation agrees with the Riksbank's main scenario, where the growth of consumption is subdued. For employment the problem is greater. Lower wage increases might be accompanied by a faster increase in labour demand.\n\nThe new information about the rate of wage increases since the December report supports the assessment that some retardation should be feasible during 1997. The wage statistics for the most recent months show signs of some improvement. Future wage formation is being discussed by the labour market organisations. Apart from this, lower wage increases in future agreements are indicated by a number of factors. Profit levels in export companies are lower and there is little possibility of passing through costs to consumers. To date in the 1997 negotiations, wage demands have been lower than in the previous round, though still high in relation to the low inflation expectations.\n\n## Inflation in line with the target\n\nOver the last six months, markets have tended to focus on the latest figures for inflation. In a way, this is hardly surprising -the figures during the autumn have been unexpectedly low. It should be emphasised, however, that the Riksbank's policy refers to a\n\nlonger period. Figures for \"'yesterday's\" inflation are therefore relevant only in so far as they say something about the future. To some extent that has been the case in the past six months; the figures have suggested a somewhat lower inflation propensity. In the main, however, they have reflected the strength of the transient effects.\n\nInflation expectations, as measured in surveys and forecasts, have been stable, in some cases with a fall during the autumn and winter. The expected rate of inflation one year ahead is around 1.5 per cent and the average rate in the next five years is around 2 per cent.\n\nWhat about the inflation forecasts for the coming years? There are many indications that the 12-month change figure for the CPI reached a low in December, with the prospect of gradually rising figures during the spring as the transient effects that pushed price increases down last year come to an end. At the beginning of 1997, moreover, prices have also been affected by, for example, changes to indirect taxes and subsidies; these changes are expected to raise the price level by about 0.5 per cent. On the other hand, house mortgage interest costs should continue to have a downward effect on prices, at least during 1997.\n\nAn upward tendency in inflation is therefore something that the Riksbank counts on in the next two years. Consequently it will not come as a surprise, at least as long as it is moderate. In the inflation report we envisaged that during 1997 the CPI would rise by an average of just under 1.5 per cent. For 1998 it was considered that inflation would be somewhat higher, around 2 per cent, which included an increase in the price level of about 0.5 per cent from further changes in taxes and subsidies (Diagram 11). The assessment accordingly pointed to a rate of inflation that would be in line with the Riksbank's target.\n\n## Same conclusion\n\nThe picture I have outlined does not warrant any change in the conclusions presented in the December inflation report. Our main scenario suggests that at present the monetary stance is relatively well balanced.\n\nThe new information about economic activity and price movements points to a picture of inflation in 1997 that is marginally more positive. In the opposite direction, the exchange rate has been somewhat weaker than we counted on. While this does not stem from what are commonly referred to as economic fundamentals, the fact remains that a weaker exchange rate -which Sweden has now had for a quarter or so -has effects on the picture of demand and inflation.\n\nThe Riksbank will continue to evaluate the effects of the interest rate cuts that were implemented during 1996. As pointed out on many occasions in the past year, we will also be keeping a close watch on the future development of economic activity. The ongoing construction of monetary policy will depend on our assessment of inflation's future course, for instance in the light of incoming information.\n\nGDP\n\nReal\n\nEmployment\n\n## Real GDP and employment in Sweden, Netherlands and the United States 1980-1996\n\nSource: OECD Economic Outlook Dec.

         "Speech given by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. E.A.J. George, at the IMF 7th Central Banking Seminar entitled Banking Soundness and Monetary Policy in a World of Capital Markets and held in Washington on 29/1/97.",
         "Mr. George looks at the question as to whether banks are still special Speech given by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. E.A.J. George, at the IMF 7th Central Banking Seminar entitled Banking Soundness and Monetary Policy in a World of Capital Markets and held in Washington on 29/1/97.\n\nMr. Chairman, I am delighted to take part in this well-directed and well-timed seminar. I am particularly pleased to be able to share with you my thoughts on the question you put to me \"Are banks still special?\" That question is partly a matter of institutional fact; but beyond that lies the question of whether the institutional characteristics of banks still justify central banks' special concern for the stability of the banking system reflected in both macroand micro-prudential oversight and in their role as lender of last resort. So the answers to those questions could have far-reaching implications for the role of central banks themselves.\n\nIn offering my answers I will ask, first, why banks have been regarded as special? Then I will ask whether banks have changed, or whether other financial institutions have become more bank-like? I will save my conclusions until the end! I am conscious, in this international forum, that I speak from a British perspective -in terms of the institutional and legal contexts and their evolution in relation to banks. But I would hope that, while some of the detail may be specific to the UK, the broad substance will not be.\n\n## In what ways have banks been regarded as special?\n\nLet me begin then by discussing why, and in what senses, banks have been regarded as special.\n\nThe term bank, historically and more than ever today, covers a multitude of sins. In practice it refers to a range of very different institutions which may, and do, within legal restraints, engage in a variety of different financial -and even some non-financial -activities whether on their own account or in an agency or advisory capacity. But banks have some key distinguishing characteristics in common. In particular they take unsecured deposits from the public at large.\n\nThe particular characteristics of bank deposits are that they are capital certain and (more or less) immediately accessible to the depositor, so that they came to be used as the principal means of making payments. In short, because of their convenience, bank deposits became the predominant repository for the immediately liquid asset holdings of the rest of the economy, and the predominant form of money.\n\nThe attraction of these deposit and payments services depends upon depositors generally having a high degree of confidence that their funds will in fact be available on demand and it depends upon the cost of the services. In providing the services, therefore, the banks need to strike a balance between deploying their deposits in low-yielding, high quality, liquid assets to meet cash withdrawals, and riskier investments to generate a higher return. In this latter context banks have traditionally played a key role in financing the corporate and household sectors, earning their return by gathering information about, and assessing and monitoring, the creditworthiness of private sector borrowers, especially those who do not or cannot cost-effectively provide the comprehensive, public, information that would allow them to access the capital markets. Much of the banks' lending, while nominally at short-term, for example in the form of callable overdrafts, is in practice illiquid and non-marketable. So a further\n\ndistinctive characteristic of banks is that they typically function with a mismatch between their highly liquid liabilities and their less liquid, non-marketable, assets.\n\nThere is no need, I think, to labour the importance to the economy as a whole of these distinctive banking functions, or the damage that would be caused if the banks' role -as the repository of liquidity, as the core payments mechanism, and as the principal source of finance to at least a large part of the economy -were seriously interrupted. That in itself helps to explain the public interest in the effective functioning of the banking system, or why banks collectively have been regarded as special.\n\nBut beyond that, the distinctive banking characteristics that I have described, of liquid liabilities and less liquid assets, give rise to special needs.\n\nGiven the banks' role in the payments system they may need late access to liquidity to square their positions vis-a-vis each other after executing payments instructions on behalf of their customers. This explains why, in their routine monetary operations to relieve shortages in the money-market, central banks in many countries tend to confine their (late) lending to banks even when they accept a wider range of counterparties in providing liquidity through open market operations.\n\nThe same distinctive characteristics make banks especially dependent upon public confidence. Bank depositors are not generally in a position to monitor or assess the financial condition of their bank, so that any suggestion that a particular bank may not be in a position to meet its liabilities is likely to lead to the panic withdrawal of its deposits. This can precipitate the suspension of payments as a result of lack of liquidity even when a bank is solvent as a going concern; and the forced realisation of illiquid assets may in itself result in insolvency. Moreover, any suggestion that one bank is in trouble may be taken -perhaps wholly unjustifiably -as evidence that other banks are likely to be facing similar problems, especially when they are engaged in similar activities. Bank runs can for this reason become contagious. And the risk of contagion is increased by inter-bank exposures, including those arising from the banks' role in the payments system. So the special nature of banks has reflected not just their distinctive functions, and the importance of those functions to the wider economy, but also their peculiar vulnerability to liquidity pressures. Central banks evolved in response to this vulnerability, which gave rise to a readiness to act as lender of last resort to the banking system in situations in which substantial systemic disturbance could otherwise occur and to an on-going concern for the macro-prudential characteristics of the banking system. And while this concern relates to the banking system as a whole, last resort assistance, when it is judged to be necessary, is extended to individual banks because problems of course arise in the first instance at the level of the individual bank.\n\nNow, the fact that central banks (in conjunction as necessary with governments) are prepared, in certain circumstances, to extend support in this way encourages bank intermediation; it represents in effect a form of subsidy, implicitly justified as being in the wider interest of the economy. It helps to preserve public confidence; and it enables the banks to take on more maturity transformation or risk than they could otherwise, so lowering the effective cost of their intermediation. But it has long been recognised that if central bank support is made available too liberally -in situations where there is no genuine systemic risk, so that it comes to be relied upon as a matter of course, then that would give rise to moral hazard. The extent of bank intermediation would be unjustifiably expanded. On the one hand, the banks themselves may be encouraged to take on excessive risks; while, on the other, depositors may be encouraged to ignore risk and to become literally care-less as to where they place their\n\ndeposits. So, both the safety and soundness of the banking system, and its competitive efficiency, and that of the financial system more generally, may be undermined.\n\nCentral banks' macro-prudential concerns for the stability of the banking system have necessarily meant that they have taken a close interest in the risk characteristics of individual banks as the component parts of the system. But more recently (at least in the UK -with the coming into force of the first Banking Act in 1979) individual banks were brought under formal banking supervision for the first time, and non-bank depositors provided with limited deposit insurance. Such micro-prudential supervision of each individual bank, of course, also helps to reduce the risk of instability in the system as a whole, and even limited deposit protection may reduce the risk of bank runs, at least in the form of the sudden withdrawal of retail deposits. This, too, of course, can give rise to moral hazard problems if it is perceived as tantamount to a guarantee. But micro-prudential supervision and deposit insurance were introduced in the UK at least (though not in the US) with the distinct, social, purpose of providing individual, small, depositors with a degree of protection against the sudden loss of their principal liquid asset holdings. This made banks, and bank deposits, special in a different sense insofar as similar formal supervision and asset protection were not (at that time) extended to other financial intermediaries or their liabilities.\n\nThese then are the respects in which banks have hitherto been regarded as special. Let me now move on to consider whether, or to what extent, the banks have kept their distinctive characteristics, or to what extent other financial institutions have developed similar characteristics so that banks are no longer special in that sense.\n\n## To what extent have banks changed?\n\nIt is certainly true, as I noted earlier, that banks engage in a range of financial activities besides those which I have described as distinctively banking activities. Major banks everywhere have increasingly diversified the products and services they offer, built up investment banking businesses and trading activities, extended into life insurance, and so on, sometimes on a single balance sheet or sometimes in separate non-banking entities. In the present context, however, the question is whether these developments have fundamentally altered the characteristics of the banking part of their balance sheets. It seems to me that the answer, generally speaking, is that they have not.\n\nOn the liabilities side, while there may have been (indeed in some countries, where close substitutes for money, such as money-market mutual funds have taken off, there certainly has been) some erosion of the banks' market share as a repository for liquid asset holdings, that erosion has generally been very gradual. In the UK, for example, bank (and building society) deposits still account for 42% of personal sector liquid asset holdings against 50% a decade ago; the proportion would be very much higher if liquid assets included only those that are capital certain. And the vast bulk of the banks' liabilities remain in the form of unsecured, short-term, deposits. Despite the rapid development of (secured) repo markets, only some 3% of the major UK banks' funding (in sterling and foreign currency together) was secured (from information provided last Autumn) through repo; and the figure for all UK banks, including the business conducted in branches and subsidiaries of overseas banks, which have less direct access to deposits, was only around 842%. The proportion of secured funding is below 5% for other major internationally active banks that we have looked at, with the exception of JP Morgan and Bankers Trust -both somewhat special cases -where the proportion is very\n\nmuch higher (25-35%). And even in those special cases it is still well below that for the major US securities firms (typically 55-80%).\n\nBanks remain, too, at the heart of payments systems. Payments may be made directly across bank accounts through instructions, for example, in the form of cheque or debit card; or they may be made indirectly, through, for example, the use of credit cards, the balances on which are subsequently settled using a bank account. Even where disintermediation creates new chequing facilities, as for example, in the case of money-market mutuals, these are still cleared through settlement banks. It is true that new forms of money transmission -e-money -are being developed, sometimes outside the conventional banking system. But I suspect that they, too, will typically depend upon clearing through the banking system. To the extent that they come to involve the creation of what are effectively direct deposits, they will represent banking in a different form and become special, and logically subject to regulation, in much the same way as conventional bank deposits. In the payments system context, too, important progress is being made to reduce inter-bank exposures (through the introduction of real time gross settlements systems in many countries, for example, and through the netting of foreign exchange settlements) but those exposures, as well as inter-bank exposures incurred in direct inter-bank transactions -the large bulk of all of which are unsecured -remain extraordinarily large. Individual inter-bank limits can substantially exceed 25% of capital (the normal supervisory limit for large exposures), and as an example of aggregate inter-bank exposures the major UK retail banks currently place some £115 billion, or 16% of their total assets, with each other or with other UK banks.\n\nTurning to the assets side, there is some evidence of a gradual erosion of the role of banks in financial intermediation. One measure in the UK is a decline in the banks' (and building societies') share in the assets of the whole financial sector (including securities firms, collective investment vehicles, and life assurance and pension funds' investments etc) which has fallen fairly steadily over the past 10 years, from close to 70% to some 55%. I believe that in the US, where financial innovation has probably been even greater, comparable figures also show this decline, from around 45% in the mid-1970s to about one third now.\n\nIn the UK, bank lending to the corporate sector has fallen, erratically, from some 27% of total corporate borrowing outstanding (including all forms of debt as well as equity issuance) in 1985 to less than 17%. This mainly reflects the increased access of larger corporate borrowers to the domestic and international capital markets for short and longer-term corporate paper, where they often have a better credit rating than banks. Smaller corporates, on the other hand, remain very heavily dependent upon bank finance -for well over half their overall needs. Meanwhile the banks' share of net external finance of the personal sector has not changed much at all over the past decade, at around 80%.\n\nTrends in the liquidity of bank assets are difficult to assess because liquidity itself is so hard to judge simply from balance sheet categories. The advent of securitisation and the direct sale of loans ought to have helped. But except in the US, securitisation has in fact so far made only limited progress, and debt sales have been focused mainly on impaired developing country or corporate debt. One reason why prime corporate loans are not so far traded is the importance that both banks and borrowers still attach to their mutual relationships. My guess is that the liquidity of bank assets by these means will gradually increase; and that process may be helped by the development of techniques such as credit derivatives. But for the time being -and indeed some time to come -bank loans are, for the most part, likely to remain illiquid in most countries.\n\nWe can nevertheless look at the crude balance sheet data, and, for what they are worth, we have looked at the share of loans to non-banks in total assets as a measure of the liquidity of the asset portfolio for a range of different types of institution. These data show that:\n\n- -for some representative small, domestic, UK banks the loan ratio is still some 70-80% of the total, apparently with no particular trend;\n- -for large UK, internationally-active, banks the share of loans is currently around 50%, having fallen quite sharply from some 65-70% some five years ago, perhaps reflecting the expansion of their investment banking activity;\n- -for large continental banks the share of loans is either side of 50%, having fallen more gradually.\n\nAgain JP Morgan and Bankers Trust are outliers. Their loan ratio to total assets is down to around 12% from around 50% in 1985 and 30% only 5 years ago. That is still much higher than the illiquid asset ratio for the large US securities firms which has fairly consistently been around 2%.\n\nThe conclusion that I draw from all of this is that while there certainly have been important changes affecting the banks, and the environment in which they operate, they have not, yet at least, been such as to affect fundamentally their relevant key functions or the importance of those functions to the economy; nor have they altered fundamentally the distinctive characteristics of either the banks' liabilities or their assets.\n\n## To what extent have other financial institutions become more like banks?\n\nSo, then, to what extent have other financial institutions developed similar characteristics to the distinctive characteristics of the banks as I have described them?\n\nThe question, let me be quite clear, is not whether other financial institutions perform economically or socially important functions -clearly they do -and those functions may equally be special in their own distinctive ways.\n\nIt is also obviously true that, with the upsurge in financial innovation and globalisation that we have seen in the past 10-20 years, there has been substantial blurring of the boundaries between different types of financial institution and the increasing emergence of multifunctional, multinational, financial groups, so that non-bank institutions have taken over banks or offered banking services just as banks have entered substantially into non-banking financial activities. But that is not the issue either. The question is whether the distinction between banking and non-banking financial functions has been eroded, again whether those functions are carried out in separate entities or on the same balance sheet. I do not think it has.\n\nTake, for example, long-term savings institutions -life insurance companies and pension funds. They clearly perform a vital economic and social function, and they are subject to separate functional regulation because of their special importance as homes for the long-term savings of the personal sector and as providers of long-term capital. But their liabilities are totally unlike the very liquid liabilities of banks, and the liquidity of their assets and liabilities are much more closely matched -indeed their marketable assets tend to be more liquid than their liabilities. The distinction remains even where these activities are carried out in a banking\n\ngroup, though in this case the different businesses have to be conducted on ring-fenced balance sheets and subject to different prudential tests, reflecting the quite different nature of the contracts and the different risks involved. That is not to deny that there may well be risks running from one part of the group to another -for example reputational risks or operational risks arising from shared systems or personnel and so on. It is not to deny either that there can be large cross-functional financial exposures. That, of course, is why the respective supervisors need to take an interest in all parts of a financial group and in intra-group exposures. But none of this, it seems to me, means that long-term savings institutions have taken on the distinctive special characteristics of banks.\n\nSo far, I would hope, so good in the sense that perhaps most of you would agree that this particular distinction remains. But have I chosen this extreme example as an Aunt Sally?\n\nWell perhaps to a degree I have. So let me take some less obvious cases.\n\nWhat about money-market mutual funds, for example? Surely they at least have some of the characteristics of banks? They, too, act as a repository for liquidity and it is possible to make payments from some of them, which looks very like a banking arrangement? And so it does. But in fact I think this appearance is deceptive, for three reasons:\n\n- -first, investments in money market mutuals are not, as I understand it, in principle capital certain (though in practice they may be supported by the fund's sponsor); nor are they covered by deposit insurance (though this may not always be understood by the investor);\n- -secondly, as I mentioned earlier, money-market mutuals are not themselves at the heart of the payments mechanism, but in effect piggy-back on the banks which are;\n- -and, thirdly, money market mutuals do not undertake maturity transformation by making illiquid loans; like all collective investment schemes they put their investors' funds into marketable instruments in accordance with the rules of the fund.\n\nWhereas money-market mutuals have something of the character of banks on the liabilities side of their balance sheets, but not on the assets side, the converse is true of non-bank finance companies. They do make illiquid loans, much as banks do. But they typically fund themselves in capital markets or from the banking system, and do not offer capital-certain, immediately available, liabilities to the public at large which are in any way comparable to bank deposits. Nor do they typically offer payments services.\n\nBut what about the free-standing securities houses -and in particular those of American and Japanese parentage that have, up to now, been separated from commercial banking activity by the Glass-Steagall Act and by Article 65? They, surely, have both liquid liabilities and engage in maturity transformation; and, of course, they do actually operate partly through banking entities outside their home jurisdictions.\n\nAgain, however, I think appearances may deceive. The liabilities of the houses are not in fact a bit like bank deposits. While it is true that the houses have increased the extent of their unsecured funding, for example through public issues, the bulk of their liquid liabilities are still secured -with, as I said, some 55-80% of the total funding of the US houses we have looked at typically in the form of repos. Nor do the houses hold themselves out to take deposits\n\nfrom the public at large. Nor, finally, are their liabilities directly usable as a payments medium. In all these respects the houses' liabilities are non-monetary -even if they can rapidly be turned into money.\n\nOn the assets side of the balance sheet, the securities houses continue to invest primarily in liquid, marketable assets which can readily be sold. This is partly a reflection of the nature of investment banking business, in particular trading, underwriting and so on, and of regulatory requirements, but also of funding uncertainty: the securities house protects itself by being able, if necessary, to contract the size of its balance sheet very rapidly. Illiquid assets continue to be a small proportion of the total, generally of the order of 2%, and the houses mitigate the maturity transformation risk in holding these, and marketable assets of more doubtful liquidity (such as some emerging market instruments), by matching with long-term borrowings.\n\nWhat is certainly true is that the securities houses have expanded their activities enormously -with balance sheets extending to $100-200 billion, which puts them in this respect on a par with large international banks. And, given their focus on trading activity -in money, capital and foreign exchange markets -they are, of course, huge counterparties of the banks, with very large exposures both among themselves and between them and the banks, but with the important distinction that exposures between, or to, securities houses are more typically secured.\n\nSize in any event does not in itself mean that the securities houses now have the special, distinguishing, characteristics of banks -any more than the long-term savings institutions or the money funds or indeed large non-financial corporates, which may also have huge balance sheets and which may also have large Treasury operations in-house to manage the funds for own account.\n\n## Systemic risk\n\nSo it seems to me that banks are indeed still special insofar as they continue to perform distinctive economic functions and insofar as their liabilities and assets still have distinctive characteristics. This means that there is still a distinct public interest in the activities of institutions that are engaged in banking -as defined -whether as free-standing entities or within a broader group structure. That interest includes a micro-prudential concern to provide some measure at least of protection to public depositors, reflected in the supervision of individual banking institutions and in deposit protection schemes. But it includes also a macro-prudential concern with the stability of the banking system as a whole, because of its peculiar vulnerability to contagious -systemic -disturbance, reflected in central banks' preparedness to provide liquidity to the system where that is judged to be necessary.\n\nOther forms of financial activity also perform distinctive functions, and have distinctive characteristics which make them special in their own different ways. And these special features equally may -and often do -give rise to special public interests. The public interest in these other financial activities may be driven by a social concern to protect consumers (for example the prospective beneficiaries of pension funds or life insurance policy holders, or investors, whether in collective funds or individually, through different kinds of intermediary, in capital markets), which is similar to the social concern relating to depositor protection. And it may extend to other aspects of the particular activity, including aspects of business conduct as well as the financial integrity of the institutions involved. In fact the public interest in non-banking financial activity has certainly increased in this sense -both in terms of the range of\n\nactivities covered and the standards of protection demanded -as is reflected in the spread of financial regulation over the past 10-20 years as the activities themselves have expanded. Our own Financial Services Act, for example, which provides for formal regulation of investment business dates only from 1986. A corollary of this broadening public interest is that multifunctional financial services providers are bound to be subject to a broadening range of functional regulation -however such regulation is structured.\n\nWhat I think is less clear is the extent and nature of the public macro-prudential interest in non-banking financial activities. I have argued that other, non-banking, financial activities are not -because of the different characteristics of the related liabilities and assets -subject to runs in the same way as banks, and that they are not therefore subject to contagious -systemic -disturbance in the same sense as banks. But that does not mean that non-bank financial institutions cannot face liquidity pressures. It does not mean either that the failure of a non-bank financial institution could not -through its direct credit or settlements exposures to other financial institutions (bank or non-bank) -have damaging knock-on effects. Conceivably, too, such a failure could have such serious consequences for the liquidity of -or price level in -some particular sector of the financial markets, that concerns would arise for the liquidity, or solvency, of other bank or non-bank institutions that were known, or believed, to be heavily exposed to that market. In this sense size does matter -and, whether or not one chooses to describe the risk of this happening as systemic, there is no doubt that a sufficiently large disturbance originating in the non-banking activity of one financial institution could put others in difficulty. This possibility must be of concern to financial regulators, including central banks, concerned with the stability of the financial system as a whole. It certainly in my view provides macro-prudential justification for regulatory oversight of the activity of (large) non-bank financial institutions, and of the non-banking activities of banks -quite apart from micro-prudential regulation in the interests of consumer protection. It provides justification, too, for some form of consolidated prudential oversight of multifunctional financial groups and for monitoring large exposures, both intra-group and to outside counterparties. Where a problem of this sort does arise, it may well justify technical central bank intervention to help contain it -for example by facilitating payments and settlements to minimise market disturbance. But, I would be very cautious about extending last resort liquidity provision to financial institutions not engaged in banking activity, and where the particular justification for it, based upon banks' distinctive functions and the distinctive characteristics of banks' balance sheets, did not clearly apply. While I do not think such intervention can, realistically, be excluded altogether, I am concerned that an unduly liberal interpretation of systemic risk would increase the scope for moral hazard and ultimately weaken the safety and soundness of the financial system as a whole.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMr. Chairman, my answer to your question Are banks still special? is essentially that while in some respects they may be less special than they were, they remain special nonetheless. They remain special in terms of the particular functions they perform -as the repository of the economy's immediately available liquidity, as the core payments mechanism, and as the principal source of non-market finance to a large part of the economy. And they remain special in terms of the particular characteristics of their balance sheets, which are necessary to perform those functions -including the mismatch between their assets and liabilities which makes banks peculiarly vulnerable to systemic risk in the traditional sense of that term. Perhaps the day will come -and I do not at all exclude the possibility that other financial activity will continue increasingly to be carried on alongside banking activity, even on the same balance sheet, indeed I expect that to happen. That, in my view, does not reduce the special public\n\ninterest in banking activity; although it may well affect the appropriate substance of banking supervision; and it certainly extends to banks' other, different, functional public interests, including different regulatory interests. On the other hand I am not persuaded that the special public interest in banking activity extends to non-banking financial institutions, though different functional public interests in many cases clearly do. What is absolutely clear, in a world of increasing financial integration, is that neither the financial regulators nor the central bankers among you can expect an easy life!\n\nBIS Review 13/1997",

As a consequence, my comments will be more in the nature of expanding upon his remarks, rather than in taking issue with any of his main points.\n\nAs  Governor  George  noted,  the  degree  to  which  each  of  us  regards  banks  as 'special' is bound to be colored by the history and development of banking in our respective countries. Of course, the U.S. banking is quite unique in many respects. Relative to the U.K., for example, we have many more depositories (on the order of 25,000 or so) and they operate with more regulatory restrictions on their activities than in the U.K. and many other countries. Also, our system of deposit insurance is more generous than in the U.K. Bearing these differences in mind, I will attempt to address aspects of our subject today that apply more or less generically in all countries, but I will draw on U.S. experiences for illustrations.\n\nTo begin, let me say that I found the seemingly simple question 'Are banks still special?'  to  be  deceptively  difficult.  In  reading  Mr.  George's  paper  and  organizing  my  own thoughts  on  the  subject,  I  was  compelled  to  answer  for  myself  a  series  of  even  more  basic questions such as: 'How do we define a 'bank'?', 'What do we mean by 'special'?', and 'If banks are indeed special, what does this imply about the proper stance of government vis-à-vis the banking industry and other types of financial services providers?'\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  this  discussion,  I  will  define  a  bank  rather  broadly  as  any financial intermediary that accepts deposits and extends loans to households or businesses. In the United  States,  this  definition  encompasses  domestic  commercial  banks,  branches  of  foreign banks operating in the United States, savings and loan associations, and credit unions.\n\nDefining  what  constitutes  'specialness'  is  more  difficult.  In  general  terms, analogous to Governor George's definition, I will define a 'special' aspect of banking as one in which there is a clear and pronounced public interest exceeding that present in other types of business and commerce. As I will note more fully in the following, my definition of 'special' does not necessarily imply that the special aspect of banking in question should be isolated or insulated from competition with other financial service providers. There are at least three general aspects of banks and banking that have been deemed special by many observers -- the liquidity transformation  function  of  banks,  the  provision  of  basic  financial  services  such  as  credit extension,  deposits-taking,  and  payments  processing,  and  the  linkage  between  the  banking system  and  the  conduct  of  monetary  policy.  In  the  following,  I  will  take  up  each  of  these 'special' aspects of banking in turn.\n\nSo,  is  the  liquidity  transformation  function  of  banks  still  special?  By  the  term 'liquidity  transformation  function'  of  banks,  I  refer  to  the  typical  balance  sheet  structure  of banks  that  often  features  a  sizable  volume  of  highly  liquid  liabilities  --  those  that  can  be withdrawn at par on demand  such  as  balances  in  checking  accounts  --  in  combination  with  a\n\nportfolio of generally longer-term assets that often are difficult to sell or borrow against on short notice.\n\nIt  is  probably  fair  to  say  that  there  is  considerable  agreement  among  central bankers  and  other  economic  policymakers  that  this  unique  balance  sheet  structure  creates  an inherent  potential  instability  in  the  banking  system.  Rumors  concerning  an  individual  bank's financial condition -- even if ill-founded -- can spark a run by depositors and other creditors that may  force  the  bank  to  unload  assets  at  firesale  prices  and,  in  extreme  situations,  suspend payment on withdrawal requests. Especially if the distressed institution is large or prominent, the panic can spread to other banks, with potentially debilitating consequences for the economy as a whole. Most countries with private banking systems have experienced episodes of bank panics to some degree, and  in  the  United  States,  such  panics  occurred  with  some  frequency  in  the  late nineteenth  century  and  were  a  major  factor  exacerbating  the  Great  Depression  of  the  1930s. While institutional  regimes  differ,  most  countries  have  established  safeguards  against  banking panics that rest on three basic pillars -- some form of deposit insurance (explicit or implicit), a program of banking supervision and regulation, and an institution that can act as lender of last resort.\n\nTo  come  back  to  our  basic  question  of  whether  the  liquidity  transformation function  of  banks  and  the  associated  instability  remains  'special,'  I  would  say  that  there  is simply  no  doubt  about  it.  Wherever  banking  panics  have  occurred,  their  effects  on  economic performance have been crippling. Thus, developing institutions and mechanisms that can prevent or short-circuit bank panics remains an important and 'special' goal for economic policymakers. Having  said  this,  however,  recent  experiences  in  the  United  States  and  elsewhere  have underscored  the  importance  of  going  about  this  task  in  a  way  that  does  not  overextend  the banking 'safety net.' In the United States, this lesson was painfully conveyed during the 1980s and early 1990s by the hundreds and hundreds of bank and thrift failures that occurred in these years. While this phenomenon was extraordinarily complex, many have argued that underpriced deposit  insurance  and  relatively  lax  supervision  contributed  to  the  problem  by  distorting  the incentives banks and thrifts faced in assessing the risks of their business decisions.\n\nIn response, U.S. federal banking agencies have implemented changes that trim the  banking  safety  net  somewhat  --  for  example,  by  requiring  prompt  closure  of  troubled institutions, by applying stricter rules governing the payoffs of depositors and other creditors in bank failures, and by curtailing the practice of allowing regulatory 'goodwill.' In addition, new bank  capital  regulations  such  as  the  Basle  risk-based  capital  standards,  which  have  been implemented in the G-10 and  have  served  as  a  blueprint  for  capital  regulation  in  many  other countries, have helped to provide better incentives for banks in their business decisions.\n\nTo summarize, I would argue that banks remain quite special in their susceptibility  to  runs  and  in  the  severe  consequences  that  a  large-scale  banking  panic  would involve today. Balancing the need for a banking 'safety net' to defuse potential bank runs with the need to create the right incentives for banks in assessing and assuming risk is one of the most difficult challenges we face as central bankers.\n\nA  second  way  in  which  banks  have  been  deemed  to  be  'special'  is  in  the provision  of  basic  banking  services  such  as  credit  extension,  deposit-taking,  and  payments processing.  There  is  little  question  that  these  functions  are  critically  important  throughout society.  Consumers  turn  to  banks  for  safe  investments  such  as  time  and  savings  deposits,  for transactions deposits, for processing payments, and for short- and long-term credit. Large and small  businesses  rely  on  banks  for  payment  processing,  short-term  credit,  and  backup  credit\n\nlines.  And  governments rely on the banking system to conduct  payments,  distribute  currency, safeguard tax receipts, and to serve as a conduit for monetary policy. In short, the basic business functions  of  banks  are  at  the  heart  of  the  financial  system  and  the  economy  overall.  By  the definition  I  put  forward  earlier,  I  would  have  to  say  that  these  basic  functions  performed  by banks are and will remain special. However, it is far from clear that these functions can only be performed by banks or that there is always a 'special' public purpose in ensuring that banks' role in performing such functions is protected.\n\nIndeed,  as  Governor  George  noted,  nonbanks  have  made  impressive  inroads  in markets that previously had  been  largely  banks'  domain.  For  example,  money  market  mutual funds and stock and bond  mutual  funds  have  lured  billions  of  dollars  that  formerly  had  been placed in staid bank investments such as certificates of deposits. Most mutual funds now also offer some 'banking' services such as checkwriting privileges. The advent of asset securitization has  allowed  nonbank  mortgage  companies  to  compete  successfully  with  banks  in  the  home mortgage  market,  and  nonbanks  have  also  been  important  players  in  the  explosion  of  new financial instruments such as derivatives and structured notes.\n\nFor  the  most  part,  this  blurring  of  the  traditional  lines  between  banks  and nonbanks  seems  to  be  a  positive  development.  New  competitive  forces  have  been  unleashed, financial  innovation  has  accelerated,  and  businesses  and  households  now  enjoy  a  far  greater range of choices on their menu of financial services than they did only a decade ago. Banks have responded vigorously -- and I would say successfully, given recent trends in profitability -- to the challenges posed by nonbank competitors. To be sure, such rapid changes have also posed new  risks. It is critical in this environment  that policymakers  stay abreast of  market developments to ensure that banks and nonbanks face the right incentives in assessing the risks of  their  business  decisions,  and  likewise  to  ensure  that  consumers  and  investors  have  the  best possible  information  available  to  them  when  choosing  among  financial  services  and  products. Thus, while I agree that the basic functions of banks in making credit available,  in  providing safe investment choices (deposits) for households, and in processing payments are special, I see little to be gained by insisting that banks always be the only type of entity that can provide such services.\n\nThe case of electronic money helps to illustrate the point I am trying to make. It remains to be seen how popular this form of payment will become in the United States, but the question of whether nonbank institutions should be allowed to issue electronic money is actively being debated in many countries. Some argue that issuing money is a special bank function and that electronic money should properly remain exclusively a bank product. For the time being, however,  I  along  with  other  policymakers  at  the  Federal  Reserve  have  concluded  that  any decision to reserve the nascent market for smart cards and other forms of electronic money as a province for banks alone might well stifle both competition and technological innovation in this area.  Thus,  while  most  would  agree  that  providing  efficient  payment  media  for  small  dollar transactions  is  a  'special'  function  that  banks  currently  perform,  it  does  not  follow  that  only banks should be allowed to perform the function.\n\nAs a corollary, I would  also  say  that  there  is  not  a  'special'  public  purpose  in constraining banks from competing in many other markets traditionally dominated by nonbank financial institutions. This is a subject which is especially topical in the United States because our domestic banks are more restricted in the business activities in which they can engage than are  banks  in  many  other  countries.  As  you  know,  the  Federal  Reserve  has  pushed  to  expand banks' ability to compete with investment houses in underwriting securities, and the scope for U.S. banks to sell insurance-related products has also expanded recently.\n\nThe  third  general  aspect  of  banking  that  is  often  deemed  special  is  the  linkage between the banking system and monetary policy. Of course, this is a topic that has spawned a truly vast economic literature. Without venturing into this thicket, I would simply like to note as fact that through much of the 1990-1994 period, growth of the broad U.S. monetary aggregates such as M2 was quite at odds with historical relationships to nominal income growth. Perhaps the most important factor underlying this development has been a fundamental realignment of household financial assets away from bank deposits in favor of bond and stock mutual funds and other  capital  market  investments.  This  'decoupling'  of  banking  system  deposit  liabilities  and nominal GDP became so pronounced during the first half of the 1990s that the Federal Open Market Committee downgraded the status of M2 as a policy variable. Today M2 remains only one of the many variables reviewed by the FOMC in the course of its policy deliberations.\n\nI raise this example because financial innovations and shifts in financial structure affecting  the  monetary  aggregates  in  other  countries  have  similarly  created  complications  in their  implementation  of  monetary  policy.  Indeed,  the  difficulties  in  guiding  monetary  policy during  periods  of  rapid  financial  innovation  have  been  a  factor  contributing to greater experimentation among central banks with alternative targets such as inflation or nominal GDP growth. Thus, I believe one could argue that the growth of aggregate bank deposits or money is probably less 'special' today as a policy variable in many countries than in the past.\n\nIronically,  while  the  growth  of  bank  deposits  may  be  less  special  as  a  policy guide, the special role of the banking sector as the primary vehicle in implementing monetary policy  in  most  countries  remains  unchallenged.  Most  central  banks  seek  to  achieve  their objectives through some form of interest rate management. Control over short-term interest rates is  achieved  in  every  case  I  am  aware  of  by  manipulating  the  supply  of  central  bank  reserves available  to  satisfy  banks'  demand  for  reserves.  Banks'  demand  for  reserves  is  similarly influenced  by  central  banks  either  directly  by  setting  reserve  requirements  or  indirectly  by allowing  only  banks  to  access  the  payment  system  and  then  setting  the  rules  regarding  the management of their central bank accounts.\n\nTo conclude, I would like to return to one of the questions posed at the outset of these remarks: If banks are special, what does this imply about the proper stance of government vis-à-vis  the  banking  industry?  As  I  hope  my  previous  comments  make  clear,  regulatory  and supervisory  policies  must  recognize  the  dynamic  forces  at  play  in  the  financial  sector.  Such policies must promote and exploit the competitive process in order to foster efficient delivery of services while encouraging financial and economic stability. These objectives are not likely to be achieved by regulations that arbitrarily identify and rigidly segment bank and nonbank financial markets. Rather, our goal as policymakers should be to establish rules of the game that provide proper incentives for financial institutions to accurately assess and manage the risks inherent in their business decisions. Likewise, we should foster reporting standards and information flows so that the consumers of financial services and products are as well informed as possible about the risks  and  returns  of  the  financial  services  and  products  they  buy.  To  the  maximum  extent possible, market forces should determine which bundles of financial services and products are provided by banks and other types of financial service providers.\n\nAs a final comment, I would note that sound macroeconomic policies are one of the most important ways to encourage the efficient delivery of financial services and the safety and soundness of financial institutions. Conversely, policies that result in significant macroeconomic imbalances frequently have serious adverse implications for financial institutions and banks in particular. In reviewing the past two decades in the United States, for example,  one  cannot  help  but  notice  that  the  most  severe  problems  in  our  banking  and  thrift\n\nindustries during the 1980s stemmed from serious macroeconomic imbalances -- including the accelerating inflation of the late 1970s and the costly but necessary steps to reverse that trend in the  1980s.  By  contrast,  macroeconomic  policies  that  encourage  sustainable  economic  growth with low inflation -- like those in recent years -- have a strong positive influence on the overall health of the banking sector and other financial institutions as well.\n\nBIS Review   13/1997",

         "Testimony of the Chairman of the Board of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, before the Committee on Finance of the US Senate on 30/1/97.",
         "Mr.  Greenspan  dicusses  the  accuracy  of  the  US  consumer  price  index Testimony  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  the  US  Federal  Reserve  System,  Mr.  Alan Greenspan, before the Committee on Finance of the US Senate on 30/1/97.\n\nMr.  Chairman  and  members  of  the  Committee,  I  appreciate  the  opportunity  to appear before you today. The Committee is faced with a number of complex policy issues that will have an important bearing on the fiscal health of the nation and the welfare of our people well into the next century. I will be happy to respond to questions relating to any of those issues, but in my formal comments this morning I intend to focus on the accuracy of the consumer price index.\n\nI would like to begin by commending this Committee for having done so much to bring the issue of possible bias in the CPI to the attention of the Congress and of the nation in general. The hearings conducted by this Committee in 1995, as well as the report produced by the advisory commission that was sponsored by this Committee, have advanced the discussion considerably.  These  efforts,  along  with  the  continuing  contributions  of  the  Bureau  of  Labor Statistics'  research  staff,  have  added  importantly  to  our  understanding  of  the  sources  of measurement error in the CPI.\n\nAny index that endeavors to measure the cost of living should aim to be unbiased. That is, a serious examination of all available evidence should yield the conclusion that there is just as great a chance that the index understates the rate of growth of the target concept as there is that it overstates the truth. The present-day consumer price index does not meet this standard. In  fact,  the  best  available  evidence  suggests  that  there  is  virtually  no  chance  that  the  CPI  as currently  published  understates  the  rate  of  growth  of  the  appropriate  concept.  In  other  words, there  is  almost  a  100  percent  probability  that  we  are  overcompensating  the  average  social security recipient for increases in the cost of living, and almost a 100 percent probability that we are causing the inflation-adjusted burden of the income tax system to decline more rapidly than I presume the Congress intends.\n\nA major reason for this is that consumers respond to changes in relative prices by changing the composition of their actual marketbasket. At present, however, the marketbasket used in constructing the CPI changes only once every decade or so. Moreover, new goods and services deliver value to consumers even at the relatively elevated prices that often prevail early in their life cycles; currently, that value is not reflected in the CPI.\n\nFor that  and  other  reasons  outlined  in  the  Boskin  Commission  report  and  other studies, we know with near certainty that the current CPI is off. We do not know precisely by how much, however. There is, nonetheless, a very high probability that the upward bias ranges between ½ percentage point per year and 1½ percentage points per year. Although this  range happens to coincide with the one I gave two years ago, it does reflect both the improvements in the index that the BLS has implemented since then and the emergence of evidence suggesting that the initial problem was of a slightly greater dimension than had previously been estimated. This estimate is consistent with a number of microstatistical studies as well as an independently derived macroevaluation by staff at the Federal Reserve Board, which I will discuss shortly.\n\nIn judging these evaluations, it is incumbent upon us to resist the evident strong inclination to believe that precision is the equivalent of accuracy in price bias estimation. If we cannot find a precise estimate for a certain bias, we should not implicitly choose zero as though that was a more scientifically supportable estimate.\n\nThere is no sharp dividing line between a pristine estimate of a price and one that is  not.  All  of  the  estimates  in  the  CPI  are  approximations,  in  some  cases  very  rough approximations. Further, even very rough approximations can give us a far better judgment of the cost of living, than holding to a false precision of accuracy. We would be far better served following the wise admonition of John Maynard Keynes that 'it is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.'\n\nEstimates of the magnitude of the bias in our price measures are available from a number of sources. Most have been developed from detailed examinations of the microstatistical evidence.  However,  recent  work  by  staff  economists  at  the  Federal  Reserve  Board  has  added strong corroborating evidence of price mismeasurement using a macroeconomic approach that is essentially independent of the exercises performed by other researchers, including those on the Boskin Commission. In particular, employing the statistical system from which the Commerce Department  estimates  the  national  income  and  product  accounts,  the  research  finds  that measured real output and productivity in the service sector are implausibly weak, given that the return to owners of businesses in that sector apparently has been well-maintained. Taken at face value, the published data indicate that the level of output per hour in a  number  of service-producing industries has been falling for more than two decades. In other words, the data imply that firms in these industries  have  been  becoming  less  and  less  efficient  for  more  than twenty years.\n\nThese circumstances simply are not credible. On the reasonable assumption that nominal output and hours worked and paid of the various  industries  are  accurately  measured, faulty price statistics are almost  surely  the  likely  cause  of  the  implausible  productivity  trends. The source of a very large segment of these prices is the CPI.\n\nFor this exercise, the study used the GDP chain-weight price measures. Although these  price  measures  are  based  on  many  of  the  same  individual  price  indexes  included  in  the CPI,  they  do  not  suffer  from  upper-level  substitution  bias.  Hence,  the  price  mismeasurement revealed  by  this  data  system  largely  reflects  shortcomings  in  quality  adjustment  and  in  the treatment  of  new  goods  and  services.  If,  instead  of  declining,  productivity  in  these  selected service industries was flat,  to  up  a  modest  1  percentage  point  per  year,  the  implicit  aggregate price bias associated with these service industries alone would be on the order of 1/2 percentage point or so per annum in recent years -- very similar in magnitude to the Boskin Commission estimate of total quality adjustment and new products bias.\n\nTo  be  sure,  it  is  theoretically  possible  that  some  of  the  measured  productivity declines  in  these  service  industries  merely  reflect  mispricing  of  intermediate  transfers  among various industries. Such an occurrence would cause an understatement of productivity in some sectors, but a corresponding overstatement in others. But the available evidence suggests that for these  particular  service  industries  this  theoretical  possibility  is  not  of  a  sufficiently  large empirical  magnitude  to  overturn  the  basic  conclusion  that  there  are  serious  measurement problems in our price statistics. Moreover, the study did not attempt to evaluate possible quality and new products bias in other industries.\n\nSome observers  who  are  skeptical  that  the  bias  in  the  CPI  could  be  very  large have noted that the evidence on the magnitude of unmeasured quality change and the importance of  new  items  bias  is  incomplete  and  inconclusive.  Without  a  doubt,  quality  change  and  new items are among the most difficult of the problems currently confronting the BLS. But since I raised this issue two years ago in my testimony before this Committee, a number of studies have\n\ndocumented significant new examples of cases in which the current treatment in the CPI results in an overstatement of the rate of growth of the cost of living.\n\nThere  doubtless  are  certain  components  of  the  CPI  that  are  biased  downward because quality change is handled inappropriately. One instance in which there may well be a problem  in  this  regard  pertains  to  new  vehicles,  where  it  may  be  more  appropriate  to  treat pollution control and mandatory safety equipment, at least in part, as raising price to a consumer rather  than  improving  quality,  as  is  the  present  practice.  But  the  potential  downward  bias introduced  by  current  methodology  for  such  equipment  can  only  be  slight.  We  should  be prepared  to  embrace  credible  new  research  on  quality  adjustment,  regardless  of  whether  that research  points  to  additional  sources  of  upward  bias  or  previously  undetected  instances  of downward bias. Nonetheless, currently available evidence very strongly supports the view that, on balance, the bias is decidedly toward failing to appropriately capture quality improvements in our price indexes. There is little reason to believe that this conclusion will change unless we alter our procedures.\n\nA  more  difficult  quality  related  issue  is  whether  to  reflect  changes  in  broad environmental  and  social  conditions  in  price  measures  that  are  used  for  indexing  various components  of  federal  outlays  and  receipts.  That  is,  should  the  CPI  reflect  the  influence  of factors  such  as  the  level  of  crime,  air  and  water  quality,  and  the  emergence  of  new  diseases, which  are  not  specifically  related  to  products  that  consumers  purchase?  There  is  little  in  the record to suggest that,  when  it  enacted  the  indexation  of  social  security  benefits  in  1972,  the Congress intended for the beneficiaries of that program to be compensated for changes in such environmental and social factors. Nor do these issues appear to have been raised when Congress debated  the  indexation  of  various  tax  parameters  during  the  1980s.  Taking  account  of  such conditions, particularly those that lie outside of the markets for goods and services, would be an interesting exercise in its own right, but would appear to extend well beyond the original intent of the Congress.\n\nA considerable professional consensus already exists for at least two actions that would almost surely bring the CPI into closer alignment with a true cost-of-living index. First, we  should  move  away  from  the  concept  of  a  fixed  marketbasket  at  the  upper  level  of aggregation, and move toward an aggregation formula that takes into account the tendency of consumers to alter the composition of their purchases in response to changes in relative prices. The BLS already calculates such an index on an experimental basis with a lag of about a year. If the  Bureau adopts the Boskin Commission's recommendation that  it  publish  a  'best  practice' version  of  the  CPI  with  a  lag  of  a  year,  it  should,  without  question,  build  that  index  on  the foundation of a variable marketbasket.\n\nThere is a somewhat more difficult issue as to whether the concept of a variable marketbasket  can  be  applied  in  'real  time,'  that  is,  with  the  same  degree  of  timeliness  that characterizes the current CPI. It is not possible to implement the textbook versions of any of the so-called 'superlative' index formulas in real time, because those formulas require contemporaneous data on expenditures, and those data are not presently available until about a year  after  the  fact.  However,  this  hardly  forecloses  the  possibility  of  implementing  an approximation to a superlative formula, and work should continue on the development of such an approximation.\n\nA second area that will require attention is the aggregation of prices at the most detailed  level  of  the  index.  This  is  a  highly  technical  area,  and  an  important  example  of  how research by the staff at the BLS has advanced our knowledge. Without going into the details of\n\nthe matter, it is sufficient to say that a selective move away from the current aggregation formula is warranted, and would probably make a modest further contribution to bringing the index more in line with the concept of a cost-of-living index.\n\nBeyond these rather limited steps, most of the needed developments will require time, effort, and quite possibly additional resources. It is important that the Congress provide the Bureau with sufficient resources to pursue the agenda vigorously. These are difficult problems, and they cannot be solved tomorrow or next week. But with adequate support and diligent effort, the pace of improvement should quicken. Moreover, an accelerated pace of BLS activity, and heightened congressional interest should galvanize analysts outside the government to contribute to the research effort.\n\nWhere  will  this  longer-term  effort  be  required?  One  of  the  key  areas,  by  all accounts, is quality adjustment. As the Bureau has rightly noted, they do indeed already employ a variety of methods to control for quality change, but available evidence suggests that these are not  sufficient  to  the  task.  Unfortunately,  making  improvements  on  this  front  will  be  difficult: Each  item  will  have  to  be  considered  on  its  own,  and  there  may  well  be  limited  transfer  of knowledge from one item to the next.\n\nAnother key area on the longer-term agenda will be the estimation of the value of new products to consumers. Significant innovations, such as the personal computer, the cellular telephone, and the heart bypass operation create value for consumers, even at their typically high initial  prices;  moreover,  this  value  is  even  greater  at  the  much  lower  prices  that  often  prevail when  new  products  are,  in  fact,  introduced  into  the  CPI.  A  true  cost-of-living  index  would reflect this value and its implication for the true rate of growth of the cost of living. The CPI does  not  reflect  it,  and  accordingly  fails  to  capture  a  significant  offset  to  price  rises  in  other products.  Deriving  an  estimate  of  this  value  and  building  it  into  the  CPI  will  not  be  an  easy undertaking. But conceptually, it is unquestionably the right direction to be heading, and some recent research suggests that it could measurably affect the index.\n\nOver time, we will need to investigate alternative sources of data. Already, there is interesting work being done to develop techniques for processing data collected from bar-code scanners  at  the  check-out  counter.  Scanner  data  will  allow  the  BLS  to  track  not  just  a  small sample of products, but virtually the entire universe of products in selected lines of business and, perhaps  most  importantly,  virtually  the  universe  of  transactions,  regardless  of  whether  those transactions happen on a weekday, at night, or on a holiday.\n\nWe should also move to improve our understanding of the value that consumers place on their own time. Absent such knowledge, it will be impossible for the BLS to estimate the value of many goods and services that mainly serve to enhance convenience and save time.\n\nFinally, we will have to attempt to build an understanding of why consumers shop at  the  places  they  do:  What  characteristics  of  an  outlet  are  important,  and  how  much  so? Location, hours of operation, inventory, and quality of service all are likely influences on the value that consumers place on their shopping experience, and all will be important in helping the BLS to develop a more sophisticated statistical method for dealing with the appearance of new consumer outlets, including those that operate over the Internet.\n\nEven if the BLS moves aggressively, some upward bias will almost surely remain in  the  CPI,  at  least  for  the  next  several  years.  Two  years  ago,  in  testimony  before  this Committee, I suggested that a workable structure for dealing with this situation might involve a\n\ntwo-track  approach.  That  suggestion  still  seems  to  me  to  make  sense.  The  first  track  would involve action by the BLS to address those aspects of the bias that can be dealt with in relatively short order, say within the next year. The second track would involve the establishment of an independent  national  commission  to  set  annual  cost-of-living  adjustment  factors  for  federal receipt and outlay programs. The Commission would examine available evidence on a periodic basis, and estimate the bias in the CPI taking into account both the latest research on the sources and magnitudes of the bias, and any corrective actions that had been taken by the BLS. This type of approach would have the benefit of being objective, nonpartisan, and sufficiently flexible to take  full  account  of  the  latest  information.  Moreover,  there  is  no  reason  why  the  two  tracks could not proceed in parallel.\n\nWithout the second track, we are implicitly assuming, contrary to overwhelming evidence,  that  the  most  accurate  estimate  of  the  bias  is  zero.  There  has  been  considerable objection that such a second track procedure would be a political fix. To the contrary, assuming zero for the remaining bias is the political fix. On this issue, we should let evidence, not politics, drive policy.\n\nWe  have  an  overarching  national  interest  in  building  a  better  measure  of consumer  prices  and  in  implementing  more  rational  indexation  procedures.  Through  these efforts, we are most likely to ensure that the original intent of the relevant pieces of legislation will  be  fulfilled  in  insulating  taxpayers  and  benefit  recipients  from  the  effects  of  ongoing changes in the cost of living. At present this objective is not being met.",

         "Dr. Brash looks at banking soundness and the role of the market with respect to New Zealand's banking industry Address by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Dr. Donald T. Brash, to the IMF conference on banking soundness and monetary policy in a world of global capital markets held in Washington on 30/1/97.\n\nMy address this morning is on \"Banking Soundness and the Role of the Market'. As most of you will already know, this is a subject of particular relevance to New Zealand, given that we have adopted a banking supervision approach which places considerable emphasis on the role of the market in promoting a sound financial system. In my speech today I will be outlining the key features of our new approach to banking supervision and the reasons why we have gone in this direction. Although much of my address will focus on the New Zealand experience, I will attempt to draw some general conclusions about the role market disciplines can play in promoting a sound and efficient financial system -conclusions that may have relevance for the design of banking supervision arrangements in other countries. Before I outline the new approach to banking supervision in New Zealand, I think it would be useful to give you a little background on the supervisory structure which operated at the time that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand conducted its review of banking supervision.\n\n## Background to New Zealand's Banking Supervision Arrangements\n\nNew Zealand first adopted a formalised approach to banking supervision in 1987. For most of the period from then until the end of 1995 New Zealand's approach to banking supervision was relatively orthodox. It involved:\n\nminimum capital requirements (based on the Basle Capital Accord);\n\nlimits on the amount which banks could lend to individual customers and related parties;\n\na limit on banks' open foreign exchange positions;\n\noff-site monitoring of banks, using information provided privately to the Reserve Bank;\n\nannual consultations with the senior management of banks; and a range of powers to enable the Reserve Bank to respond to bank distress or failure.\n\nHowever, the former system of banking supervision differed in some important respects from the approaches adopted in many other countries. In particular, New Zealand's supervisory framework:\n\ndid not involve the licensing or supervision of deposit-taking or the business of banking -only those entities wishing to use the word \"bank\" in their name were subject to supervision;\n\ndid not feature deposit insurance;\n\ndid not seek to protect depositors per se -instead, it sought to protect the financial system as a whole; and\n\ndid not involve any form of on-site examination of banks.\n\nThese distinguishing features continue to apply under the new supervisory framework.\n\nIn late 1991 we commenced a major review of our banking supervision arrangements. The review was motivated by a number of concerns.\n\nProbably the main reason for commencing the review was a concern that conventional approaches to banking supervision generally make insufficient use of market disciplines as a means of promoting a sound and efficient financial system. We believed that there was considerable scope to use market disciplines to promote systemic stability. In particular, we wished to provide the market with a greater capacity to hold the directors and management to account for the sound management of their bank. And we wanted to improve the market's ability to make well informed decisions as to which banks they would do business with. As I note later in this address, we concluded that the introduction of a well focused and comprehensive disclosure regime would go a long way towards achieving these objectives.\n\nAnother factor which led us to review our banking supervision arrangements was a concern at the compliance costs and regulatory distortions which can be associated with conventional approaches to banking supervision. This concern reflects our view that banking supervisors tend to have strong incentives to promote a stable financial system, without always having appropriate regard to the compliance costs and regulatory distortions to which supervision and prudential regulation can give rise.\n\nWe were also concerned at the taxpayer risk involved in the traditional approach to banking supervision. Although this risk is present regardless of the form banking supervision takes, it is likely to be greater where the banking supervisor, and only the banking supervisor, has regular access to financial information on a bank. It is also likely to be greater the more intensive the supervision process is. We wanted to explore ways of reducing the risk of the government being called upon to rescue a bank in distress.\n\nFinally, we recognised that conventional banking supervision can only go so far in promoting a sound banking system. There are inherent limitations in the extent to which prudential regulation and supervision, even supervision which includes on-site examinations, can minimise the incidence of bank distress and failure. This is evidenced by the fact that countries with intensive supervisory regimes have not been immune from serious episodes of financial distress. Indeed, we were concerned that banking supervision could even be increasing the risk of bank failure or distress, by potentially reducing the incentives for bank directors and managers to make their own considered judgements about what constitutes prudent behaviour.\n\n## The New Approach to Banking Supervision in New Zealand\n\nIn the light of these concerns, and following a lengthy period of review, we concluded that the concerns we had identified could be substantially addressed by placing greater reliance on market disciplines through public disclosure by banks, increasing the accountability of bank directors and management, and reducing the extent of prudential regulation. The new banking supervision arrangements, which came into force on 1 January 1996, reflect these conclusions.\n\nThe new approach differs from the former regime in two main areas. First, a new disclosure regime applicable to all banks operating in New Zealand has been introduced. The disclosure regime is designed to substantially strengthen the market disciplines on banks and sharpen the incentives for the directors and management of banks to manage their banks' affairs in a sound and responsible manner. I will outline the main features of the disclosure arrangements shortly.\n\nThe second major change involved a reduction in the extent of prudential regulation of banks. The main changes included:\n\nthe removal of the former limit on the amount which banks may lend to their customers;\n\nthe removal of the limit on banks' open foreign exchange exposures;\n\nthe removal of the Reserve Bank's guidelines on internal controls and the associated audit requirements; and the removal of the need for banks to privately report their financial position and risk exposures to the Reserve Bank.\n\nWe were satisfied that the introduction of the new disclosure regime obviated the need for many of the former prudential controls on banks.\n\nUndoubtedly the feature of the new approach that has attracted most attention is the disclosure regime. Let me briefly outline its main features.\n\nUnder the new arrangements, all banks operating in New Zealand must publish a disclosure statement each quarter. The disclosure statements are in two forms: a brief Key Information Summary, which is aimed at the ordinary depositor; and a more comprehensive General Disclosure Statement, which is aimed principally at the professional analyst.\n\nThe Key Information Summary contains a short summary of key information on a bank, including:\n\nthe bank's credit rating (or a statement that the bank has no credit rating); the bank's capital ratios, measured using the Basle framework; and information on peak exposure concentration, peak exposures to related parties, asset quality, shareholder guarantees (if any) and profitability.\n\nThe Key Information Summary must be displayed prominently in, and be available on demand from, every bank branch.\n\nThe General Disclosure Statement contains wider-ranging and much more detailed information on a bank and its banking group, including:\n\ncorporate information and some information on parent banks (where applicable); comprehensive financial statements (including a five year summary of key financial data); credit rating information (including any changes to the rating in the two years preceding a bank's most recent disclosure statement balance date); detailed information on capital adequacy, asset quality and various risk exposures\n\n(including exposure concentration and related party exposures); information on funds management and securitisation activities, risk management systems, and a summary of the prudential regulations imposed on the bank in question by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand; information on the bank's exposure to market risk, both peak and end of period (and in respect of the full banking book).\n\nThe disclosure statements issued by banks are subject to full external audit at the end of year and a limited scope audit review at the half year. Disclosure statements issued at the other quarters in the year are not required to be audited.\n\nOne of the most important features of the disclosure framework is the role it accords bank directors. Each director is required to sign their bank's disclosure statements (or authorise someone to sign on his or her behalf) and to make certain attestations in the disclosure statements, including:\n\nwhether the bank is complying with the prudential requirements imposed on it by the Reserve Bank; whether the bank has systems in place to adequately monitor and control its banking risks and whether those systems are being properly applied; whether the bank's exposure to related parties is contrary to the interests of the bank; and whether the disclosure statement contains all the required disclosures and is not false or misleading.\n\nDirectors face severe criminal and civil penalties (including up to three years' jail and personal liability for creditors' losses) if a disclosure statement is held to be false or misleading.\n\nThe disclosure arrangements are expected to bring a number of important benefits to the New Zealand financial system:\n\nWe are confident that the disclosure arrangements are playing an important role in strengthening market disciplines on banks. Under the new arrangements the market has considerably greater information on a bank's financial performance and risk positions than was previously the case. And the information is available more frequently and in a more timely manner. The market therefore has greater scope to react to developments affecting a bank's financial condition -rewarding those banks which are well managed and penalising those which appear to be less well managed. The strongest banks are likely to benefit from that strength by operating at lower costs; weaker banks are likely to be under pressure to strengthen their position. Over the longer term we believe that stronger market disciplines will make a major contribution to the soundness of New Zealand's financial system.\n\nAnother benefit which we expect to see from the disclosure regime is a growing emphasis on the important role which bank directors play in overseeing the prudent management of their banks. The disclosure framework reinforces and provides a sharper focus on the duties of bank directors. In particular, it sharpens the focus on directors' duties to ensure that their bank has the necessary systems in place to identify, monitor and manage adequately the bank's various business risks, and to ensure that those systems are being properly applied at all times.\n\nThe disclosure requirements are also likely to increase the accountability of bank directors and, indirectly, the accountability of various levels of management within the banks. As a result of the disclosure arrangements, we would expect to see directors taking greater care than might otherwise have been the case to ensure that they are adequately discharging their\n\nobligations. In so doing, it is likely that directors will take steps to ensure that there are appropriate accountability mechanisms within the management hierarchy.\n\nOver time, we expect that the increased accountability of bank directors will lead to an improvement in the quality of bank boards. Shareholders now face stronger incentives to ensure that the directors of their banks have the appropriate skills, experience, integrity and judgement to fulfil the duties expected of them.\n\nAnother important benefit which we hope will flow from the disclosure regime is a reduction in the risk that the taxpayer will be called upon to rescue a bank. As a result of the disclosure arrangements we hope that there will be a stronger public perception that the management and directors of a bank have the sole responsibility for the management of their bank's affairs. Moreover, the public now has access to much the same information on banks as does the Reserve Bank, thereby eliminating the monopoly of information which supervisors generally tend to have in respect of a bank's financial condition. Both of these factors should assist in enabling future governments to resist the inevitable pressures to rescue a bank in distress or to insulate creditors from losses -at least to some extent.\n\nAlthough the new supervisory framework places great emphasis on the role that market disciplines can play in promoting systemic stability, it is important to note that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand has not abandoned its responsibilities for the financial system. We recognise that, for the time being at least, systemic stability is best served by a combination of market disciplines and banking supervision. In particular, we see value in:\n\nretaining some control over which entities may call themselves banks in New Zealand;\n\nthe Reserve Bank maintaining a sound understanding of the state of the financial system; and the Reserve Bank retaining a capacity to respond to financial distress or bank failure, where this threatens financial system stability.\n\nIn this context, a number of the Reserve Bank's core functions have been retained.\n\nThe Reserve Bank continues to have responsibility for registering new banks.\n\nBanks continue to be subject to minimum capital requirements (in line with the Basle Capital Accord) and a limit on lending to related parties. Although we believe that disclosure alone would ensure that banks would maintain capital at least equivalent to the 8% minimum, we consider that retention of the minimum capital requirements reinforces the credibility of the new supervisory framework, at no additional cost to banks.\n\nThe Reserve Bank continues to monitor banks on a quarterly basis. However, monitoring is now conducted principally using banks' public disclosure statements, in contrast to the former system of monitoring on the basis of information provided privately to the Reserve Bank. In most respects, banks' disclosure statements contain information which is more comprehensive and more reliable than the information previously provided privately to the Reserve Bank.\n\nThe Reserve Bank also continues to consult with the senior management of banks. Formal prudential consultations are held annually, and generally focus on the strategic direction of the banks, major changes in their operations and other high level issues. In addition, as Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, I meet with the chief executives of the larger banks on a regular basis to discuss a broad range of issues, including issues relating to the banking industry and to the wider economy.\n\nAnd, importantly, the Reserve Bank retains a wide-ranging capacity to respond to financial distress or bank failure where a bank's financial condition poses a serious threat to the stability of the banking system.\n\nAs with the former supervision arrangements, the objective underlying the above responsibilities is the promotion of a sound and efficient financial system. Depositor protection does not feature in the Reserve Bank's objectives.\n\n## Reactions to the New Approach to Banking Supervision\n\nAll in all, I believe that the new approach has been relatively well accepted. But it has taken time for that acceptance to be achieved. It is fair to say that, during the review process, reservations about the new approach were expressed from a number of quarters, both at home and abroad. I think it would be useful to mention some of these.\n\nOne of the observations made has been that New Zealand is \"free riding\" on the efforts of the home supervisors. We firmly reject this notion. We believe that the new supervisory framework is at least as effective at promoting prudent banking practices as are the more traditional approaches to banking supervision. And we are satisfied that the new framework enables the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to fulfil its duties as a host supervisor within the terms of the Basle Concordat. In that regard, under the new approach to banking supervision, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand remains well informed about the activities and financial condition of all banks operating in New Zealand, and well placed to respond to incipient financial distress where appropriate. Indeed, as I have already noted, the disclosure regime provides the Reserve Bank (and the public) with information which is generally more comprehensive than the information previously received by the Reserve Bank.\n\nBut it is certainly true that any host supervisor will -inevitably -rely to some extent on the global supervision of the home supervisor. After all, this is an intrinsic part of the Basle Concordat. The most a host supervisor can realistically achieve is to promote prudent banking practices in the local operations of the banks within its jurisdiction.\n\nIn the context of the above point, some commentators have suggested that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is not well placed to anticipate emerging financial distress in the absence of conducting on-site examinations of banks or otherwise obtaining private information from banks. Although I acknowledge that on-site examinations do increase the information available to banking supervisors, I am not at all convinced that the information obtained from such examinations enables the supervisors to reliably anticipate incipient financial distress. In modern banking, risk positions can and do change rapidly. A week in politics might be a long time, but in banking it is a very long time indeed! This is becoming increasingly the case. The information obtained from on-site examinations, or from any other sources for that matter, can only provide a snapshot of a bank's risk positions at a particular point in time, and even then generally only in respect of a subset of the bank's business. For these reasons I believe any such\n\ninformation is of limited usefulness in assessing the dynamics of a bank's risk positions or in anticipating financial distress.\n\nI acknowledge, of course, that publicly disclosed information also has these limitations. But at least public disclosure brings with it the incentives for the sound management of banking risks. I am not at all sure that the private disclosure of information to a banking supervisor -whether on-site or off-site -creates these types of incentives.\n\nA further concern we have with on-site examinations or the off-site collection of detailed private information on banks, at least in the New Zealand context, is the risk that these approaches can blur the lines of responsibility for the management of banks. If the banking supervisor has responsibility for regular on-site examinations, it presumably follows that the supervisor also has responsibility for encouraging or requiring a bank to modify its risk positions or make other adjustments to its balance sheet where the supervisor has concerns in relation to the bank's risk profile. This has the potential to erode the incentives for the directors and management of banks to take ultimate responsibility for the management of banking risks, effectively passing some of this responsibility to the banking supervisor. It also has the potential to create public perceptions that the responsibility for managing banking risks is effectively shared between a bank's directors and the banking supervisors. In turn, this makes it very difficult indeed for a government to eschew responsibility for rescuing a bank in difficulty.\n\nI acknowledge that any system of banking supervision -even one that relies principally on public disclosure -will inevitably create public expectations that the supervisory authority takes some responsibility for the management of banking risks. And I acknowledge that any system of banking supervision creates a risk for the taxpayer in the event that a bank gets into difficulty. However, in order to minimise these risks, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand prefers to keep the spotlight clearly focused on the directors and management of a bank, rather than risk a further blurring of their accountability. We believe that the avoidance of having an on-site examination role or otherwise regularly obtaining private information from banks assists in this regard and reinforces market disciplines on banks.\n\nAnother observation frequently made is that New Zealand would not have adopted the new framework had a substantial part of its banking system been domestically owned. It is my firmly-held conviction that we would have adopted this approach even if all or most of our banks had been locally-owned. I say this because we believe that the regime is actually more likely to promote prudent banking behaviour than do the more traditional approaches, but with a lower likelihood of moral hazard and regulatory distortion. In this context, I should note that, at the time we commenced our review of banking supervision, in late 1991, a significant part of the New Zealand banking system was still domestically owned. Indeed, as I see it, many of the changes we have implemented in New Zealand would be of equal relevance to those jurisdictions in which the core of the banking system is domestically owned.\n\nAnother criticism made of the New Zealand approach is that comprehensive and frequent disclosure can, in some circumstances, exacerbate financial system distress, rather than promote systemic stability. I acknowledge that, in some circumstances, disclosure could exacerbate a bank's difficulties. For example, where a bank is required to disclose a loss or a severe deterioration in asset quality, this could lead to a sharp adverse reaction by the market, possibly causing the bank in question to come under liquidity pressure. Of course, this possibility exists with even the barest disclosure requirements -such as with the release of an annual report or a six monthly interim disclosure. And the risks of adverse market reaction are present even in the absence of disclosure requirements -for example, as a result of market\n\nspeculation as to a bank's financial condition. Indeed, in some circumstances the disclosure of comprehensive information might actually reduce the risk of the market reacting adversely to misinformation or to an absence of information. In any case, where a bank knows in advance that it will be making adverse disclosures, it would generally have the opportunity to take steps to reduce the risk of an adverse market reaction. These steps would include the disclosure of the remedial measures being taken to address the bank's difficulties.\n\nOf course, the risk of a severe market reaction to an adverse disclosure creates the very incentives for banks to ensure that they manage their affairs in such a way that there will be no adverse developments to disclose. In the longer term, therefore, the risk of adverse market reaction could be expected to promote a sounder financial system.\n\nOne of the criticisms often made of public disclosure by banks is that the vast majority of depositors will not read banks' disclosure statements. On this assumption, some observers suggest that disclosure is of very limited effectiveness. We do not agree. It is certainly true that most depositors are unlikely to read the disclosure statements. But the disclosure regime in New Zealand is not predicated on the assumption of wide readership by the ordinary depositor. The source of market disciplines does not lie in wide public readership. Rather, the efficacy of the disclosure regime rests on the assumption that the disclosure statements will be read by the agents of depositors, such as the financial news media, financial analysts and investment advisers, and by wholesale creditors and fellow bankers. It is the risk of adverse reactions by these types of disclosure users that creates the incentives for bank directors and management to manage their banks' affairs in such a way as to avoid the need to make adverse disclosures.\n\nAlthough the disclosure regime does not rely on the mass readership of disclosure statements by depositors, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is encouraging depositors to take a greater interest in their banks' disclosures. Over much of last year we actively promoted publicity about the new disclosure arrangements. And we prepared a \"user's guide\" to assist depositors (and their agents) to understand the disclosures being made by banks. The user's guide is now available in every bank branch in the country. While it is unlikely to be a \"best seller', it is encouraging to note that there has, in fact, been a surprising degree of interest in it from the public. We hope that, over time, an increasing proportion of depositors will take a keener interest in their banks' financial condition.\n\nAnother observation made about the new framework is that our approach places an excessive emphasis on the role of bank directors -that we are asking too much of them. To illustrate this point, during the review process, I had a visit from the chief executive of one major international bank with an operation in New Zealand. He had come to protest strongly at the requirement that bank directors would have to sign the disclosure statements every quarter and attest to the appropriateness of their risk management systems. When I asked why, he said \".,.. bank directors understand absolutely nothing about banking...\". This comment is quite unfair about many bank directors, of course, but there is an uncomfortable element of truth in it in some cases. The blame for this situation almost certainly lies, in part, on a supervision regime which had assumed too much of the responsibility for the viability of banks. We very much hope that a regime which will continue to have some key regulations, but which is based primarily on market disclosure and director attestations, will improve that situation.\n\n## Early Indications of the Effects of the Disclosure Regime\n\nAlthough it is far too early to make conclusive assessments of the success or otherwise of the new supervisory approach, there have been some encouraging signs that the disclosure requirements are meeting a number of their objectives. I will briefly highlight a few of these.\n\nWe have been encouraged by the fact that the financial news media in New Zealand have taken a close interest in the new bank disclosure regime. The quarterly disclosure statements have received quite detailed scrutiny from the news media, resulting in greater and more focused public exposure of banks' financial results and risk positions. We hope that this type of media attention will sharpen the incentives for banks' directors and management to manage their banks' affairs prudently.\n\nA good example of the news media's interest in banks' disclosure statements was the media's interest in one bank's disclosure of its non-compliance with a Reserve Bank prudential requirement. We were surprised at the intensity of the media's interest in this disclosure -as, I suspect, were the management and directors of the bank in question. Hopefully, this type of media attention, and the attendant adverse publicity to which it inevitably gives rise, will encourage banks to ensure that they comply with Reserve Bank requirements in the future. I am inclined to think that the threat of adverse publicity is likely to be a more effective discipline on banks than are many of the standard supervisory sanctions for breaches of regulatory requirements.\n\nInterestingly, the disclosure regime seems to be strengthening the extent to which banks scrutinise each other's financial performance and risk positions. We are aware that banks are making considerable use of the disclosure statements to monitor each other. The additional and more frequent information now available could be expected to assist banks in managing their inter-bank exposure positions and in assessing the extent and nature of the business they conduct with each other. We believe that the banking industry itself is one of the most potent sources of market disciplines on individual banks.\n\nAnecdotal feedback suggests that the obligations now placed on bank directors are causing the directors of some banks to exercise greater scrutiny of their banks' risk positions. In turn, this seems to be focusing greater attention on the systems they have in place for identifying and managing risks. Moreover, it seems that some banks are taking steps to increase the accountability of various levels of management within their banks. We are also aware that some banks have engaged external consultants to review aspects of their risk management systems. It seems that part of the motivation for conducting these reviews lies in the disclosure requirements -particularly the director attestation as to the adequacy of a bank's risk management systems.\n\nThese are all pleasing developments. We hope that they auger well for the success of the new arrangements. I am confident they will. But we are under no illusion that the new arrangements provide guarantees of financial system stability. Of course they do not. No system of banking supervision can do that. The most we are entitled to believe is that the disclosure regime will significantly reduce the likelihood of financial system instability in the future -at lower regulatory, compliance and taxpayer costs than other supervisory options might be expected to achieve.\n\nBIS Review /1997\n\n## General Observations on Incorporating Market Disciplines into Banking Supervision\n\nBefore I conclude this address, I should probably make some comments about the extent to which market disciplines could be better incorporated into the supervisory frameworks in other countries.\n\nI should first of all make it clear that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand is not promoting the New Zealand supervisory model as the ideal model for other countries to adopt. We make no such claims. The model we have adopted meets our particular needs, but it might not necessarily be suitable for other countries. Clearly, each country needs to make its own judgement as to what type of supervisory framework is best suited to its unique requirements. That judgement will inevitably depend on many considerations, including:\n\nthe objectives which banking supervision is expected to meet, and whether those objectives include depositor protection;\n\nthe existence or otherwise of deposit insurance arrangements;\n\nthe structure of the banking system; and the infrastructure within which banking operates, such as banking law and accounting standards.\n\nHaving said this, I do believe that market disciplines can play a substantial role in most financial systems. In particular, I think policy makers in many countries could usefully give careful thought to the merits of introducing comprehensive and well focused disclosure requirements for banks. Similarly, I believe there would be much to gain from the adoption of policies designed to strengthen the responsibilities of bank directors, so that the ultimate responsibility for the management of banking risks lies squarely in the boardroom, rather than being awkwardly balanced between the banking supervisor and the bank director.\n\nBut it is fair to say that the effectiveness of market disciplines will much depend on the structure of the regulatory arrangements in place and the nature of the infrastructure within which the banking system operates. In particular, the following factors would seem to play an important role in determining the effectiveness of using disclosure as a mechanism for promoting systemic stability.\n\nMarket disciplines are more likely to be effective where governments do not insulate depositors from losses -whether explicitly in the form of deposit insurance or through implicit depositor protection. Understandably, depositors and other creditors are less likely to take an interest in a bank's financial condition where they know, or have good cause to surmise, that they will be insulated from losses should a bank get into difficulty. In such circumstances, banks which are performing poorly are less likely to face adverse market reaction than in an environment where creditors operate under the expectation that they are likely to lose money in the event of a bank failure. In part, this is why, in New Zealand, we have eschewed deposit insurance or depositor protection, and have sought to make it clear to depositors, among others, that they should not expect the government to insulate them from losses in the event of a bank failure.\n\nIt is also fair to say that market disciplines are more likely to be effective where the supervisory requirements applied to banks are kept to a minimum. I say this for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the greater the supervisory requirements, the more likely it is that the market will perceive that the government is underwriting individual banks. And second, the greater the supervisory requirements, the less likely it is that bank directors and management will view themselves as having ultimate responsibility for the management of their banks.\n\nThe effectiveness of market disciplines will also depend on the structure of the financial system. In particular, it seems likely that market disciplines would be more effective where a bank is domestically owned -that is, where no other bank stands behind it. Where a bank is owned by another bank, the market would naturally have regard to the financial condition of the parent bank when assessing how it should react to disclosures made by the local bank. Market disciplines might therefore be somewhat more subdued in a financial system characterised by foreign ownership than in one dominated by locally owned banks. Having said this, I am fully satisfied that even in a financial system which is largely foreign owned, such as in the New Zealand financial system, there is very considerable scope to use market disciplines to promote improved risk management by the subsidiaries and branches of foreign banks. Indeed, it is possible that New Zealand's disclosure regime might well be adding to the incentives on overseas parent banks to more vigilantly supervise their New Zealand operations and to give greater attention to their own financial condition.\n\nThe extent of government ownership of the banking system is also likely to influence the effectiveness of market disciplines. I think we would all agree that the market is less likely to impose meaningful disciplines on a bank which is state owned than would be the case with a privately owned bank -assuming, of course, that the market has faith in the financial soundness and political stability of the government in question. However, even where a bank is state owned, a robust disclosure regime might well strengthen the accountability of the directors and management of the bank, leading to improved risk management within the bank.\n\nIt will come as no surprise to you that I believe that market disciplines are more likely to be effective where banks are required to make comprehensive disclosures on a frequent and timely basis. The disclosure requirements should focus on the key aspects of a bank's financial performance and risk profile, and should be made with sufficient frequency and timeliness as to provide the market with a meaningful basis for assessing a bank's financial condition and comparing one bank with another. Disclosure is likely to be more meaningful and effective if it is supported by robust accounting standards which have the force of law. Certainly, in the case of New Zealand, we have found that our disclosure regime has been assisted greatly by the introduction of legally binding and more rigorously drafted accounting standards. Moreover, disclosure requirements should ideally be coupled with an appropriate legal framework governing bank directors -a framework designed to focus directors' attention on their duties to manage the affairs of their bank in a sound manner, and to hold them to account for any breaches of those duties.\n\nHowever, as they say, there is a time and a place for everything. And so it is with disclosure. I think we would all agree that it would not be helpful to introduce new disclosure requirements at a time when the banking system is in a fragile state. Doing so could well exacerbate the situation. That is why, in New Zealand, we introduced the disclosure regime at a time when the financial system was in a strong position and therefore when disclosure would assist in maintaining confidence in the banking system, rather than detracting from it.\n\nFinally, the effectiveness of market disciplines through public disclosure will obviously be influenced by the infrastructure within which banking operates. By \"infrastructure\", I refer to such matters as: the nature and adequacy of corporate law; the\n\nadequacy of accounting standards and auditing requirements; the sophistication and integrity of the accounting profession; and the adequacy of the financial news media and financial professionals.\n\nAll else being equal, the more well developed the infrastructure, the more likely it is that market disciplines will be effective. This suggests that, in the case of some developing countries, where perhaps the infrastructure is not well developed, the scope for using disclosure to promote market disciplines is somewhat more limited than would otherwise be the case. But even in such cases, I would not dismiss the potential merits of developing relatively simple disclosure requirements, drawing on international accounting and auditing standards as appropriate, as a means of promoting some rudimentary market disciplines.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLet me conclude by reiterating my view that market disciplines can play a powerful role in promoting systemic stability, in conjunction with some degree of banking supervision. I think there is considerable scope for policy makers to give further thought to how market disciplines could be better used to reinforce the efforts of banking supervisors in the quest for systemic stability. However, in giving thought to this matter, it may well be necessary for policy makers to re-assess some fundamental aspects of the conventional approaches to banking supervision and their relationship to the promotion of market disciplines. These include such issues as depositor protection, deposit insurance, the extent of prudential regulation of banks, and the intensity with which banking supervision is conducted. These are all substantial issues of course, and I have little doubt that there will be continuing international debate as to where the appropriate balance should lie. I very much hope that the approach which we in New Zealand have adopted will assist in promoting international debate on supervisory options.",

         "## M. Hannoun\\_ discusses\\_issues\\_relating to financial markets and European\n\nMonetary Union Article by M. Hervé Hannoun', a Deputy Governor of the Bank of France, published in the autumn 1996 issue of \"revue d'économie financiére no. 38\".\n\nWhat impact will Monetary Union have on the financial markets?\n\nI should preface any attempt to answer that question by saying that the financial markets have already been affected by Monetary Union, even though 1 January 1999 is still in the future. The interest rates on the French-franc market for maturities of 3, 5, 10 and 30 years already incorporate 1, 3, 8 and 28 years in euro. this means that medium-term market rates for the French franc already depend on the soundness and the credibility of the euro.\n\nThe first part of this article will deal with the changeover of the markets to the euro on 1 January 1999. The second part will discuss the more strategic issue of the new environment that will affect the leading European financial markets as a result of Monetary Union.\n\n## 1. The technical preparations for the 1999 changeover of the markets to the euro are already well under way.\n\n## 1.1. The Options Chosen\n\n## 1.1.1. A Two-Stage Scenario\n\nThe scenario adopted comprises two stages, with the changeover in wholesale transactions occurring in the first and the changeover in retail operations in the second.\n\nThe changeover in the financial markets will occur rapidly because, starting on | January 1999, the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) will conduct its monetary policy in euro and the Monetary Union Member States will denominate their new government securities issues in euro. Then, by 1 January 2002, at the latest, when the euro bank notes and coins have been introduced and general government agencies have made the changeover to the euro, all retail banking activities will be conducted in euro.\n\nDuring the transitional period from 1999 to 2002, banks will be on the frontier between two spheres, with the euro-denominated markets on one side, and the world of retail transactions, where national currencies will continue to be used, on the other. At the place where the two spheres meet and overlap, banks will play the vital role of interface, making them an important driving force in the changeover of the markets to the euro.\n\nConverters will enable banks to meet the demand for euro from non-financial agents and let them integrate transactions on markets where the quotation, trading and settlement systems all operate in euro, into an economy where the national currency is bound to remain in widespread use. The converters will be located in the financial institutions.\n\n## 1.1.2. The changeover will occur on 1 January 1999 for flows in the financial markets. It will be more gradual for the outstanding stock of securities and transactions.\n\nThe objective of the Paris banking and financial community is for all of the markets to change over\n\n1 This article was written with the help of Denis Beau, the head of the French-franc trading room and Yves Nachbaur, Deputy Manager of the Financial Markets Division.\n\nBIS Review 7/1997\n\nto the euro completely and for good on | January 1999. This applies to the foreign exchange, money, bond and equity markets.\n\nHowever, we must make a distinction between the flows, which are the market transactions, and the stock of outstanding securities and market instruments exchanged in these transactions or underlying them. The diagram below shows that the changeover in terms of flows will be complete and immediate, whereas technical considerations will make the changeover in terms of stock more gradual and, in some cases, the pace of the changeover may differ.\n\nThe Changeover of the Markets to the Euro\n\n| Markets                 | Flows (transactions)           | Stock (instruments)                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Foreign Exchange Market | Euro (1/1/1999)                | Euro                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Money Market            | Euro (1/1/1999) Quotes Trading | Euro Automatic conversion of  Ecu- denominated securities Rapid conversion of outstanding French-franc securities and repos into euro New government securities issues in                                                |\n| Bond Market             | Euro (1/1/1999) Quotes Trading | Euro/Franc Automatic conversion of  Ecu- denominated bonds Conversion of outstanding government bonds at the start of Stage 3 Gradual conversion of outstanding private-sector bonds New government bonds issued in euro |\n| Equity Market           | Euro (1/1/1999) Quotes Trading | Euro Conversion of par values into euro on 1/1/2002                                                                                                                                                                      |\n\n## 1.2. The Impact of the Changeover on the Ways Markets Work\n\n## 1.2.1. The Foreign Exchange Market\n\nThe foreign exchange markets are set to change over to the euro on 4 January 1999. In practical terms, this means that non-euro-area currencies will be quoted against the euro exclusively.\n\nCurrency rates on the euro market could be quoted quite naturally as rates against the euro to ensure continuity with practices on the Ecu market, where the rates for all currencies, including sterling, are quoted as rates against the Ecu.\n\nAt the same time, the institutions' foreign exchange holdings of euro-area currencies must be converted into the single currency and settlements arising from the interbank foreign exchange market will be made in euro.\n\nMarket professionals' open interest in swaps, futures and options on euro-area currencies will automatically be converted, with the substitution of the euro for the national currencies of the euro area countries.\n\nThe immediate changeover of the foreign exchange market will call for some operating rules to be worked out by | January 1999.\n\nSuch rules should cover such matters as the way benchmark exchange rates are worked out. The Banque de France publishes daily benchmark rates for the franc against various other currencies. These rates are often used for valuation for tax, accounting and prudential purposes. Benchmark rates will still be needed after 1 January 1999 to give the euro price of non-euro-area currencies. We must make sure we know how this need will be met.\n\nRules must also be defined to harmonize value dates. The creation of a unified foreign exchange market for the whole euro area will be an incentive for such harmonization.\n\nOther rules will be needed for dealing with open interest in currency futures and swaps on currencies from the countries entering Monetary Union. By 31 December 1998 at the latest, the final value of such contracts will be known for certain, and a cash settlement price can then be worked out on the basis of the difference between the rate originally contracted and the irrevocably-fixed conversion rate that is ultimately set. The questions that then arise are whether contracts should be liquidated early or whether they should continue to run until their originally agreed maturities. These are the kinds of questions that the working groups are studying at the moment.\n\n## 1.2.2. Interest-Rate Markets\n\nThe changeover to the euro on 1 January 1999 will not raise any problems for quotes on interest-rate markets, because they are given as rates or percentages of par values. Cash settlements arising from delivery-versus-payment securities transactions will be made exclusively in euro in the RGV and RELIT securities settlement systems.\n\n## The Money Market\n\nThe changeover in the money market should occur quickly for transactions in the interbank, negotiable debt securities and repo segments.\n\nOn the interbank market, the changeover will be facilitated because, starting on 1 January 1999, monetary policy transactions will be conducted in euro, the banks' accounts with the central banks will be held exclusively in euro and the large-value payment systems will operate in euro. The TARGET system, which will handle all monetary policy operations and many interbank payments, will be operational and should ensure perfectly smooth circulation of central money, thus enhancing the effectiveness of the changeover process.\n\nBIS Review\n\n7/1997\n\nOn negotiable debt securities market, the outstanding government bonds will be converted into euro immediately. The technical process of converting other debt securities will be facilitated by the fact that most of them are short-term securities issued or held by credit institutions. Nevertheless, the participants in these markets must define the technical procedures for converting securities of all maturities into euro so that they can be used as instruments in a broader euro money market.\n\nThe repo market could, of course, operate in euro with securities denominated in francs at first. But outstanding repos must be converted into euro rapidly in 1999 so as to constitute a uniform euro money market in which the expertise and experience of operators in Paris should give them an important role.\n\n## The Bond Market\n\nThe technical problems involved in the changeover of the bond market are a more delicate matter.\n\nNew State bonded debt will be issued in euro starting on 1 January 1999, and the French treasury has committed itself to converting its outstanding bonds into euro as soon as possible. This is bound to create a very favourable volume effect, but the conversion of other outstanding bond issues may occur more gradually.\n\nOne of the difficulties arising in the changeover in bonds is how to convert par values. Because bonds carry set denominations, the conversion of par values raises the problem of rounding and fractional values. For example, how should a 2,000-franc OAT bond be converted into a euro-denominated bond, and what should the new denomination be, as the franc/euro conversion rate is unlikely to produce a whole number. One solution under consideration is to create bonds with a par value of one euro each. The feasibility of this solution is under study.\n\nBenchmark rates are another problem that requires further thought and it affects both the money and bond markets. Will the benchmark rates such as the average weighted money market rate (TMP), the average bond yield (TMO) and the PIBOR still be in use after the changeover? Should we consider making some of them \"European\" rates? The dynamics of a single financial market obviously create an incentive to harmonize the market benchmark rates used in the various financial centres for the money market, and for the bond market as well. It is in everybody's interest for the different financial centres to work together and with the monetary authorities on these issues, which the EMI will also study as part of its work on the harmonization of market standards.\n\n## Interest-Rate Derivatives Markets\n\nOn the interest-rate derivatives markets, the changeover to the single currency will lead to the constitution of a euro yield curve. Traders will be able to start trading on this curve immediately. Financial centres, such a Paris, must be prepared to:\n\n- -offer a complete range of products covering all the strategic points on the new yield curve as soon as possible;\n- -ensure that the liquidity of contracts denominated in national currency is transferred to euro contracts.\n\nSome 80% of the trading volume on the MATIF futures market in Paris involves interest-rate products, and all of them are to be converted into euro on 1 January 1999.\n\nBIS Review 7/1997\n\nWith this in mind, MATIF SA, and the market players, have just presented a strategic plan aimed at providing participants with instruments covering the whole euro yield curve in 1999, and ensuring greater liquidity for the existing French-franc products, for example, by introducing a five-year contract. MATIF SA has also decided that PIBOR contracts maturing after 1999, will be traded in an environment of euro-denominated benchmark rates, and not French franc rates.\n\n## 1.2.3. Equity Markets\n\nThe banking and financial community opted for a simultaneous changeover for the monthly settlement, spot, and OTC equity markets on | January 1999.\n\nStarting on 1 January 1999, shares, profit-sharing certificates and convertible bonds will be quoted in euro. Credit institutions' entire securities operations will change over to the euro all at once. The market intermediaries will install converters to provide the interface for customers holding French-franc denominated accounts during the transitional period up until 1 January 2002.\n\nThe changeover in equity transactions will be a complex project that must reconcile the use of the euro for quotations and delivery-versus-payment settlements with the use of the French franc by issuers for their accounting. French-franc issuers will have to convert the par values of their shares at a later date.\n\nThus, if we wish to limit the number of conversion operations that the intermediaries will have to carry out, we should examine which legal conditions would enable listed companies to express the financial flows relating to their securities issues and dividend payments in euro during the transitional period.\n\nTransactions with customers will continue to be dealt with in the national currency during the transitional period, particularly in the case of shares. On the other hand, the changeover to the euro in over-the-counter market transactions between professionals is unlikely to raise any special problems. Markets always adapt rapidly by nature. The work under way proves that market professionals are determined to be ready on time, but the legal framework defined for the use of the euro also has an important role to play. The options chosen in the draft European regulations on the status of the euro provide market participants with a clear-cut legal framework that will make the changeover easier.\n\n## 2. European Financial Markets and Monetary Union: The New Environment\n\nThe changeover of the financial markets to the euro on 1 January 1999 requires appropriate technical preparations to set the ground rules. But, within this carefully defined framework, the strategic responses of the participants and institutions involved will be vitally important. The Paris financial market should be able to build on its considerable advantages to flourish as the environment grows more competitive.\n\n## 2.1. Expected Changes in the Competition between European Financial Centres\n\n## 2.1.1. Short-term interest rates will be the same throughout the euro area.\n\nEntry into Monetary Union will be based on macro-economic convergence, irrevocable fixing of exchange rates, a single monetary policy and fiscal policies that are consistent with the Stability Pact. This means that the main macro-economic factors influencing the value of financial assets should become more uniform.\n\nBIS Review 7/1997\n\nSubstitution between financial assets within the same categories should become easier, even though the issuers are still of different nationalities. This phenomenon is bound to have the greatest impact on interbank deposits, because the single monetary policy within the euro area will mean that banks with comparable credit ratings should logically pay the same rate of interest, no matter which country they are from. It follows that the prices of other categories of short-term securities, which are usually set with reference to interbank interest rates, should also start to show uniform yield curves. For example, the prices of French Treasury bills (BTFs) are set with reference to interbank rate expectations via the arbitraging mechanisms linking the interbank rates to their derivatives in the form of interest-rate futures and swaps.\n\n## 2.1.2. At the long end of the yield curve there may be some residual differences between government bond markets in the euro area.\n\n- 2.1.2.1. Entry into Monetary Union is a powerful factor for producing uniform yields on the participating countries' government bonds.\n\nTraditionally, two essential factors are put forward to explain differences in government bond yields. These are the premiums to cover credit and exchange risks. As Monetary Union is based on macro-economic convergence and irrevocably fixed exchange rates for the countries taking part, these premiums should be greatly reduced, or even disappear.\n\n## Theoretical Impact on the Credit Risk Premium\n\nTraders will distinguish between the creditworthiness of two sovereign issuers if they feel that the risk of default is not the same in both cases. The credit risk depends directly on the issuer's debt servicing capacity. The assessment of a government as a credit risk is naturally based on an estimate of how sound its financial position is. The criteria that the major rating agencies and others usually apply relate to the main aspects of a country's economy, such as growth, inflation, the balance of payments, fiscal balance and outstanding government debt.\n\nOn the basis of these criteria, the countries in Monetary Union should, in theory, be given comparable credit ratings. Entry into Union requires strict adherence to the convergence criteria and compliance with the Stability Pact. These are serious guarantees of durable macro-economic convergence in the participating countries.\n\nThe leading international agencies have already given comparable ratings to the countries with the most similar economies, which are also the ones most widely believed by the markets to be the first to enter Monetary Union on | January 1999.\n\n## Theoretical Impact on the Exchange Risk Premium\n\nOperators will demand a higher yield before investing in a foreign market if they perceive an exchange risk. This extra yield, or premium, offsets the losses that could be incurred due to a change in the exchange rate.\n\nThe exchange risk between the various countries entering Stage Three of Monetary Union will disappear on | January 1999. The yield differentials between these countries' government securities reflecting the risk of variations in the exchange rates between their currencies should naturally cancel each other out.\n\nThe euro is to be as strong and credible as the leading currencies in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism today. It will be a magnet for savings from non-euro area countries. A very large and\n\nBIS Review 7/1997\n\nliquid market of European government securities with fairly uniform features can be expected to emerge as an alternative to dollar-denominated investments. This is another factor contributing to uniform yields on bonds issued by the governments of countries in the euro area.\n\n- 2.1.2.2. Some economic and technical factors could be an obstacle to uniform yields and residual differentials may persist.\n\nThe logical conclusion of the theoretical considerations outlined above would be that there is no fundamental reason for the yields on government bonds in the euro area to diverge once Monetary Union has been achieved. However, not all analysts agree with this prognosis and major financial players are conducting intensive research to estimate the yield differentials on euro-denominated government securities and to identify the determinants. Three main types of factors could explain the persistence of residual yield differentials.\n\n## Investor Behaviour in the New Euro Area\n\nThe irrevocable fixing of the parities between the currencies participating in Monetary Union and the economic convergence requirements for entry will eliminate many sources of the market segmentation and have a twofold impact on the flow of investment into interest-rate markets.\n\n- -There will be a reallocation of the savings invested in interest-rate products within the euro area; and\n- -a greater share of the total savings is likely to be invested in interest-rate markets outside the euro area.\n\nThese potential portfolio reallocations could be related to the fact that the range of assets on offer in the euro area countries will be less attractive once Monetary Union has been completed, because the variations in the exchange rates between their currencies, which can cause the value of the securities they issue to increase, will have been eliminated.\n\nThe changes in the prices of interest-rate products in euro area countries will be increasingly similar, making these products less attractive for international portfolio managers, who use modern portfolio management strategies based on diversification to optimize the risks-rewards relationship.\n\nThe disappearance of exchange risk will also lead to reallocation by inciting portfolio managers who had previously limited their activity to the domestic market to expand into the markets in other euro area countries. A major source of risk in investing in foreign markets within the euro area will have been eliminated and the factors affecting interest-rate product prices in two different Monetary Union currencies will become more and more similar.\n\nThis restructuring of interest-rate product portfolios could actually help maintain yield differentials on various euro area government securities. Since the bond markets in the euro area would appear to be good substitutes for each other once Monetary Union looks like a viable proposition, there would be a risk that the reallocation of cross-border investment flows could favour the markets with the most attractive technical features. The substantial technical differences between markets in the euro zone could, all things being equal, introduce yield differentials on government securities.\n\nHowever, some major institutional investors in the euro area currently have management constraints, such as the matching principle for insurance companies, that limit their ability to buy securities denominated in other currencies. We cannot rule out the possibility that such investors may overlook the technical differences between national market segments in the euro area and\n\nincrease their investment in securities carrying a premium. This would further contribute to a convergence of yields within the euro area.\n\n## The Way Fiscal Policy is Implemented\n\nArticle 104b of the Maastricht Treaty prohibits joint financial liability between the Member States. This means that when investors define and implement their portfolio strategies, they will still be just as sensitive to differences in fiscal policies as before, even though these policies will never be able to stray far or for long from the discipline laid down in the Stability Pact.\n\nUnder these conditions, the slightest sign perceived by the markets as a loosening of fiscal policy will be penalized by a widening of the yield differential between the offending country and the other countries in the euro area.\n\n## Technical Elements\n\nTechnical differences between national bond markets that have not been ironed out by the start of Stage Three could also contribute to the persistence of yield differentials on government securities.\n\nThe prime causes would be differences in the liquidity of government bonds stemming from the various governments' issuance policies, unequal development in repo markets and whether stripped bonds are available for investors wishing to take more sensitive positions.\n\nOther causes could be differences in taxation and regulatory requirements affecting intermediaries and investors.\n\n- 2.1.2.3. Sizeable yield differentials between different bond markets could have a big impact on market benchmarks and financial asset pricing techniques.\n\nFinancial asset pricing techniques all rely on the riskless yield curve and this raises the question of which rates will constitute this curve in the euro area. It could be made up of the lowest rates at each point along the curve, in which case it would not be very uniform. Or else, it could be made up of the average yields on government bonds. The lack of an undisputed benchmark curve could lead to varying practices within the market.\n\nThis problem could result in the interest-rate swap curve being taken as the benchmark curve, since the swap market is very wide and the technical conditions are the same everywhere. Indeed, we can see that the convergence process has already had a more pronounced impact on the interest-rate swap market. As this will continue after the start of Stage Three, the yield curve based on swaps can be expected to be more uniform than the government bond yield curve, thus prompting operators to use it as the benchmark for their pricing techniques.\n\nUp until now these techniques have been based on the riskless yield curve. They will have to adopt a new and radically different benchmark.\n\n## 2.1.2.4. Certain measures can be considered to minimize yield differentials as far as possible.\n\n- -Issuing strategies could be harmonized. Differences in issuing patterns relating to the range of securities on offer, the degree of fungibility and standardization of coupon payment dates, as well as issuing timetables can create liquidity premiums that vary from one country to the next on the same segment of the yield curve. For example, the differences in the yields on 2-year issues in France and Germany are amplified by the lesser liquidity of the German securities. Sweden has\n\nalready started to standardize coupon payment dates by aligning that of its latest 10-year issue on the most liquid line of the 10-year French OAT bonds (25/10/2006).\n\n- -Issuing techniques and market-making techniques on the secondary market could be harmonized. Here again, differences in the techniques used can create yield differentials between comparable securities. This type of phenomenon is undoubtedly at work for French and German bonds. The Bundesbank's auction technique, which combines syndication, competitive bidding and tap issues, as well as its presence in the secondary market are in contrast to the mainly competitive procedures used for French Treasury issues with bid-price auctions and the marginal role played by the Treasury on the secondary market.\n- -Taxation could be harmonized. Here, the priority should be on harmonizing taxes on income and capital gains from bonds. The example of municipal bonds in the United States, where tax exemptions lead to lower yields on these bonds than on federal government bonds, shows that tax considerations have a substantial impact on yields. It would also be a good idea to harmonize tax collection techniques, with the preference being given to withholding taxes on bonds.\n\n## 2.2. The Strengths of the Paris Market in the New Environment Created by Monetary Union\n\nThe Paris financial centre and its participants have substantial advantages to meet the new competitive challenges in financial markets. These advantages will enable them to seize the opportunities offered by Monetary Union for the development of their activities.\n\n## 2.2.1. A Wide Range of Competitive Financial Services and Products\n\nParis offers an array of financial services and products that enjoy a strong position in the international competition.\n\n- -The regulated markets, SBF, Bourse de Paris and MATIF, rank among the world leaders. MATIF is Europe's second largest derivatives market. The French equity market has surged ahead in recent years and attracts large numbers of foreign investors, who currently hold about a third of the total market capitalization.\n- -Paris OTC markets, particularly for derivatives, are technically advanced and highly active. According to a Banque de France survey published in April 1995 as part of a coordinated project involving six financial centres under the aegis of the Bank for International Settlements, France's derivatives markets rank fourth world-wide, accounting for 6.4% of world activity. The transactions are highly international, with 76% of the transactions in currency derivatives and 47% of the transactions in interest-rate derivatives involving non-resident counterparties.\n- -France's attractive money market is open to industrial and commercial companies, allowing them to issue negotiable debt securities. It is based on highly efficient repurchase agreements. The repo market has grown substantially in recent years. The volume of the main operators' lending granted under repurchase agreements with delivery of the securities increased twelve fold between the fourth quarter of 1991 and the fourth quarter of 1994, and then it doubled again by the end of 1995. This form of repo accounted for only 3% of the main operators' lending on the interbank market in 1991, but this figure increased to 37% in 1995. The Banque de France worked hard to achieve this increase. It helped eliminate legal risk with a market agreement introduced in September 1988, followed by a second version, backed up by a standard repo contract in July 1990. At the same date, the Banque de France also introduced Treasury bill repos for its bid tenders. This momentum was\n\nreinforced in 1994 and 1995 by an Act of Parliament defining the repurchase agreement with delivery of the securities. The Act cleared up the remaining uncertainties over the legal and tax status of repos. The Treasury also set up a circle of market-makers, creating a class of primary dealers in Treasury repos (SPVTs-Spécialistes en pensions sur valeurs du Trésor).\n\n- -Paris has a large bond market driven by both publicand private-sector issuers. The overall value of outstanding issues on the French bond market stood at USD 1,011 billion at the end of 1995, which is 16% of the world total. This makes the French market the fourth largest in the world, behind the American, Japanese and German markets.\n- -Paris offers fast and reliable delivery-versus-payment settlement systems. In 1997, the Transferts Banque de France, or TBF, real-time gross settlement system will be introduced as part of the risk-prevention programme. It will provide immediate finality of payment for large-value funds transfers throughout the day. At the same time, the delivery-versus-payment securities settlement system will be unified and provide same-day settlement as part of the Relit Grande Vitesse Project (RVG).\n\n## 2.2.2. An Attractive Government Debt Market that will Set the Pace in the Euro Area\n\nThe French government securities market is one of the key advantages that Paris enjoys in the run-up to the euro. It is based on a system of market-makers, where the primary dealers are known as SVTs, and offers a very large pool of securities covering the whole spectrum of the yield curve. It is one of the world's most advanced and efficient bond markets.\n\nIt benefits from the Treasury's issuance policy, which currently offers three key advantages: simple products; highly liquid lines (many of which are fungible); and maximum regularity of issuance. The other advantages of the market include the group of specialized operators, who are the primary dealers in Treasury securities and the transparency of its organized procedures that are open to all investors. The market's leadership is based on the high credit rating of the French State and the highly developed MATIF futures and options market, which is one of the top-ranking markets of the world.\n\nIn a euro-denominated government debt market, where the yield differentials on bonds from the different sovereign issuers should be small, the advantages of the French debt market should attract investors to French government securities and should generate a great deal of business for all the related products, including derivatives and bonds from other French public-sector issuers.\n\nI will conclude by saying that the changeover to the euro will bring sweeping changes to the competitive environment in financial markets. But it will not necessarily lead to disruption, if the markets have prepared properly for the transition. The ESCB, with its multiple-based operations, will ensure equal treatment of the various financial centres.\n\nA key differentiation factor will be the skills and the expertise of the trading-room teams. This means Paris has everything it will take to flourish in the new competitive environment resulting from Monetary Union.\n\nBIS Review\n\n7/1997",

         "Speech given by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. E.A.J. George, at the Bankers Club Annual Banquet held in London on 3/2/97.",
         "Mr.  George  weighs  up  the  pros  and  cons  of  European  Monetary  Union Speech given by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. E.A.J. George, at the Bankers Club Annual Banquet held in London on 3/2/97.\n\nI've  been  a  follower  of  Jim  Wolfensohn  for  the  past  20  years,  and  it  is  a  great pleasure to follow him again this evening.\n\nI  first  came  across  him  when  he  was  an  extraordinary  investment  banker  reputedly flying the world with his cello strapped securely in the adjacent seat.    His  eventual appointment to the Presidency of the World Bank was inspired.  He brings to it an outstanding professionalism.  But - as you have heard this evening - he brings to it also a broad humanitarian vision and total commitment to the World Bank's task of improving the lives of people in those parts of the world that still need outside official  help with their reconstruction and development.\n\nPresident Wolfensohn's canvas tonight has been global.  My own focus will be on Europe, and in particular on European monetary union - though it's fair to say that EMU could well have significant consequences for the global economy.\n\nThis country is widely regarded elsewhere in Europe as being bloody-minded and even  obstructive  about  monetary  union,  largely  because  there  is  indeed  an  intense,  and  often impassioned,  debate  going  on  here  about  the  pros  and  cons.    And  so  there  should  be.    It's  a momentous  enterprise,  with  potentially  enormous  implications  for  Europe's  political  and economic future.  The simple fact is that there are real risks as well as real potential benefits in monetary union;  and it would be foolhardy just to assume that the enterprise, if it is embarked upon, will inevitably bring about the political harmony and economic prosperity across Europe that anyone in their right mind wants to see.  It is hugely important to all of us that Europe's political leaders stand back and weigh the risks as well as the potential benefits, dispassionately, before  any  irrevocable  step  is  taken.    If  the  debate  in  this  country  encourages  open  debate elsewhere then we will be doing a service to Europe as a whole.\n\nIt is something of a fashion these days to describe economic conditions in terms of fairy stories.  I have heard the steady expansion in the United States, and more recently in this country, described as the 'Goldilocks' condition - with the economic temperature not too hot, not too cold, but just right.\n\nIn  the  same  vein  I  might  describe  European  monetary  union  as  Beauty  and  the Beast.  The Beauty of it lies in intra-European exchange rate certainty.  And if you don't find that instantly seductive I suggest you speak, as I have, to some of Britain's exporters.  They have seen, over the past six months or so, an erratically sharp appreciation of sterling, against the core European currencies  in  particular,  which  can't  be  adequately  explained  in  terms  of  economic fundamentals.\n\nBut Beauty comes in a package along with the Beast, and the Beast in this case is the single monetary policy - the single, one-size-fits-all, interest rate.  The trouble is that it may not in the event suit the domestic monetary policy needs of the different individual Euro-area countries.  And if you don't find that instantly repulsive I suggest you ask yourself how, at this particular juncture, we could keep the economic porridge - if I may mix my fairy stories - at just the right temperature if we were obliged now to have German-level interest rates.\n\nNow you can't just hope the Beast will never appear.  I don't know of any serious analysis that doesn't acknowledge that tensions could arise between the domestic policy needs of\n\nthe  different  member  countries  -  as  a  result  of  different  cyclical  positions,  or  different  fiscal policies, or as a result of external shocks which affect some member countries more than others, or as a result of structural changes in one member country as against another.  The risks, like the potential benefits, are, as I say, real.\n\nYou  might  more  reasonably  hope  that  Beauty's  Beast  will  turn  into  Prince Charming - and that all their problems turn out to be little ones.  But I have to tell you that it was always at this point in the story that I began to wonder if my mother was making it all up!  In any  event,  you  need  to  be  rather  confident  that  the  potential  tensions  are  indeed  likely  to  be minor, or at least short-lived, because, if they do turn out to be serious, then you could be stuck either with a weak Euro - and more rather than less inflation, higher rather than lower interest rates over the medium-term, and exchange rate instability against outside currencies - or, if the European central bank is allowed to do its job in accordance with its statutes, you could be stuck with  persistent  stagnation  and  unemployment  across  the  economically  weaker  parts  of  the Euro-area.  It's not enough, it seems to me, to shrug one's shoulders and say 'well, that's what happens now anyway within individual countries';  at least within individual countries there are alternative adjustment mechanisms, in the form of labour mobility and fiscal redistribution, to moderate the tensions, which will be much less effective within the Euro-area.\n\nThe architects of the Maastricht Treaty clearly knew all about the Beast, and they evidently shared my scepticism about it turning naturally into  Prince  Charming.    The  famous convergence criteria are there precisely in order to reduce the risks of tensions emerging after the start of the Euro.  One can argue about how far they do in fact reduce the risks.  But it would be a reckless gamble to charge ahead if even those criteria were not met - sustainably, and in substance rather than just in form.\n\nSo there needs to be a serious debate.  But it would be disappointing if that debate degenerates  into  recrimination  and  antagonism.    That  would  be  to  obscure  the  remarkable consensus that now exists - throughout the European Union and indeed more widely, and across a broad spectrum of political opinion within the countries of Europe, including this country, on the  broad  approach  to  macro-economic  management.    This  unforced  consensus  extends  to monetary  policy  directed  to  price  stability,  and  it  extends  to  budgetary  policy  directed  to medium  and  longer-term  fiscal  sustainability.    There  is  growing  recognition,  too,  across  the continent,  of  the  importance  of  structural  policy  directed  to  supply-side  flexibility.    This strengthening consensus is fundamentally important - more fundamentally important, in terms of the economics of it at least, than whether these common objectives are pursued inside or outside the framework of monetary union.\n\nPulling these thoughts together, it would be a mistake in my view for monetary union to go ahead without reasonable confidence of genuine, sustainable, convergence between its  members;    and  it  would  be  a  mistake  for  any  individual  country  to  seek  to  join,  or  to  be permitted to join, unless it had achieved genuine, sustainable, convergence.  If there are serious doubts - generally or in any particular case - it would be in no-one's interest to proceed.\n\nBut it would be just as big a mistake, if monetary union does not go ahead, or for countries on the outside, if  individual  governments saw that as an opportunity to seek to take short-term  advantage  of  the  apparent  macro-economic  freedom  that  that  gave.    It  would  be against their longer-term national economic interest;  and countries behaving in this way should not be at all surprised if  other  European  Union  countries  sought  to  protect  themselves  against disruptive behaviour.  With or without monetary union, within it or outside, it is of overriding importance that we all continue to pursue stability-orientated macro-economic policies.  On that\n\nbasis I can see no reason, and certainly no right under the Treaty of Rome, for distinctions to be made  among  the  member  states  of  the  European  Union  whatever  the  outcome  on  monetary union.  Indeed we would all suffer if they were, because it would reduce the potential benefits of the  single  market  to  Europe  as  a  whole.    Whatever  the  surrounding  noise,  we  must  surely  be smart  enough  to  avoid  cutting  off  our  nose  to  spite  our  face  in  that  way.    Our  national  and collective economic interests are too closely aligned for that to be allowed to happen.\n\nSo I am not particularly impressed either by the fears sometimes expressed about the  economic  penalties  that  will  be  visited  on  countries  outside  monetary  union,  or  by  the occasional rattling of the cage to try to bully them into it.  Unless we are convinced, as I say, in general or in any particular case, that Beauty will in fact end up with Prince Charming, and not be condemned to long-term cohabitation with the Beast, then it would be better for Europe as a whole to delay until we were more confident of a happy ending.\n\nInvestment  will  continue  to  flow  to  this  country  so  long  as  we  succeed  in maintaining an environment offering attractive returns, and our macro-economic and supply-side policies are a much bigger factor in that than the exchange rate.\n\nSimilarly  the  City  will  continue  to  flourish  as  Europe's  international  financial capital  so  long  as  the  strongest  financial  firms  from  all  around  the  world  continue  to  find  it attractive  to  conduct  their  business  here.    I  see  no  signs  of  that  changing:    indeed  the international business of the City continues to increase;  and that has very little to do with our national  currency,  or  with  an  expectation  that  we  will  be  among  the  first  to  merge  it  into  the Euro.\n\nSo long as we are properly prepared, as we will be, and so long as we have in place efficient infra-structure, including for payments and settlements, as I assure you we will have - in or out, then the Euro, if it comes, will be more of an opportunity than a threat to the City.  There are those who sometimes give the impression that they think the Euro could - by regulation  or  restrictions  -  be  confined  to  within  the  territory  of  the  Euro  area,  and  that  this would be 'a good thing'.  That I have to say is not our experience.  In practice unnecessary or ineffective  domestic  regulations  or  restrictions  have  often  been  the  cause  of  financial  activity growing up elsewhere.  In any event we live in a global financial world and the Euro is bound to become a widely-used and actively-traded currency internationally.  Its liquidity is likely to be a key attraction to domestic and foreign users alike.  The City of London both contributes to, and thrives upon, liquid markets, and the Euro-market, or the euro-Euro-market if we are an 'out', will  be  no  exception.    That  can  only  be  good  for  the  development  of  financial  activity  -  the provision  of  competitive  financial  services  -  across  Europe  as  a  whole,  because  we  are  not talking  here  about  a  zero-sum  game.    Euro-activity  in  London  is  likely  to  stimulate  financial activity  in  other  centres  and  vice  versa;    and  much  of  that  activity  will  be  undertaken  by branches  or  affiliates  of  the  same  major  financial  firms.    The  first  ecu-Euro  bond  raised  last week by a European borrower and managed from London by a Swiss/British and a French bank and by another French bank in Paris, is a good example not just of London's international role as it  is  today,  but  of  how  it  is  likely  to  continue.    In  this  area,  too,  therefore  I  see  our  national interests coinciding rather than conflicting with the collective European interest.  That is why the Bank  of  England,  at  all  levels,  is  playing  a  full,  active,  and  constructive,  part  in  both  the preparatory  work  of  the  EMI,  and  in  the  technical  preparation  of  London's  great  financial markets.  If monetary union goes ahead, with or without the UK, we have a vital interest in its success, and we will do all that we can to ensure that outcome.\n\nMr President, I am delighted to see so many bankers from around the world here again this evening - and generally looking so prosperous.  And, come what may in relation to EMU, I confidently look forward to seeing you all at this great banquet again next year, and for many years to come - looking just as prosperous.  It is in that context that I ask you to rise and join  me  in  a  toast  to  the  Bankers  Club  -  coupled  with  the  name  of  its  President,  Sir  William Purves.\n\nBIS Review   14/1997",

         "Speech given by the Governor of the Bank of Japan, Mr Yasuo Matsushita, at the Keizai Club in Tokio on 4/2/97.",
         "Mr Matsushita comments on recent monetary and economic conditions in Japan Speech given by the Governor of the Bank of Japan, Mr Yasuo Matsushita, at the Keizai Club in Tokio on 4/2/97.\n\n## I. Introduction\n\nI truly appreciate this opportunity to address this distinguished audience at the invitation of the Keizai Club.\n\nOver the past several years, the Japanese economy has had to overcome the aftereffects of the bursting of the economic \"bubble\" while facing the weighty challenge of establishing an economic structure suitable for the new era. Although there were concerns about a deflationary spiral at one time, the economy has been recovering moderately since the beginning of 1996 partly due to strong monetary and fiscal support. Recently, this economic recovery has gradually firmed, offering signs that progress has been made toward establishing this suitable economic structure.\n\nHowever, since the beginning of the year, stock prices have fallen significantly, suggesting that market participants remain cautious about the economic outlook. With this in mind, I would like to discuss the Bank of Japan's thinking on the recent economic developments and monetary policy management, together with the Bank's views on the uncertain factors regarding the economic outlook.\n\n## II. Domestic Economic Condition\n\nWith regard to the domestic economic condition, the Bank of Japan's judgment is that a moderate economic recovery continues, and that the economic recovery is gradually becoming firmer.\n\nWhen considering the strength of an economic recovery, the Bank pays attention to the positive interactions between production and private demand. Specifically, attention is given to whether the increase in production is leading to an expansion of business fixed investment through improved corporate profits, and whether this increased production is followed by a recovery in personal consumption through increased income.\n\nLooking back on the economic developments in Japan over the past year from a viewpoint of determining the strength of the recovery, the growth of aggregate demand, including public and housing investments, accelerated in the first half of 1996, and accordingly, market expectations of an economic recovery strengthened and longterm interest rates showed a temporary rise. However, no significant improvement was seen in production, as the increase in final demand was partly offset by inventory adjustment and by an increase in imports. As a result, a virtuous circle of demand, production, and income was not confirmed.\n\nThis situation, however, appears to have changed somewhat in the latter half of 1996. Firstly, the decline in external demand, which had been a constraining factor of the economic recovery, halted in autumn 1996, mainly due to the increase in exports that followed a depreciation of the yen. Recently, there has been an upward trend in external demand. In addition, inventory adjustment in some raw materials and semiconductor industries was almost completed. As a result, production, which had remained sluggish in the first half of 1996, started to grow at an accelerating pace, reflecting fully the increase in final demand.\n\nNotably, the firm recovery in production is now generating a recovery in private demand, including business fixed investment and personal consumption. Reflecting improvements in corporate sales and profits, the recovery in business fixed investment is spreading to a wider range of industries and to smaller firms than previously observed. Indeed, according to the results of the November 1996 \"TANKAN --Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan,\" business fixed investment for the smaller firms, which had been slow to improve, is expected to show a year-to-year increase in fiscal 1996 for the first time in five years.\n\nGrowth of personal consumption, the other mainstay of private demand, leveled off at one time in summer 1996, but resumed later in autumn, especially in consumer durables such as automobiles. The contributing factor to the moderate but steady recovery in personal consumption has been the improved income reflecting the favorable changes in employment conditions and wages that followed the increase in production.\n\nIt must be borne in mind that the increase in demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate scheduled for fiscal 1997 is contributing to the improvement in economic indicators, as in housing investment, and therefore these improvements need to be seen in this light. There has, however, recently been a notable change in economic developments compared to the first half of 1996. Despite a gradual decrease in public-sector investment from the latter half of 1996, the virtuous circle --in which increased production leads to increased private demand through improved corporate profits and employment income --has clearly begun to operate.\n\n## Ill. Uncertain Factors Regarding the Economic Outlook\n\n## A. Views of Financial Market Participants\n\nTurning from the Bank of Japan's views on the current domestic economy, the issue of concern now is the future development of the economy. Revitalization of economic activity usually brings about increases in corporate profits and employment income, which lead to improvements in business fixed investment and personal consumption. These improvements in turn lead to a further expansion in economic activity.\n\nHowever, developments in financial markets, such as stock prices and longterm interest rates, suggest that despite the increasing strength of the economic recovery, market participants remain cautious about the economic outlook. Various causes are cited for the significant fall in stock prices since the beginning of the year: renewed concern about the nonperforming-loan problem; uncertainty over the social and economic systems in Japan as a whole; and pressures to decrease the differential between domestic and international stock prices in terms of various measures of evaluation, such as the price/earnings ratio. It is extremely difficult to assess each factor and to specify the cause of the uncertainty. Still, the overall trend in the financial markets over the past several months clearly indicates that market participants have a cautious outlook on the economy, as shown by the slowdown in growth or even a decline in stock prices since autumn 1996, and by the concurrent decline in long-term interest rates.\n\nCautiousness on the part of the market participants reflects the fact that they are strongly aware of the following three issues: (1) effects of the anticipated fiscal tightening in the next fiscal year; (2) structural adjustment pressures facing Japanese industry; and (3) balance-sheet adjustment of firms and the nonperformingloan problem of financial institutions, both of which are burdens created by the economic \"bubble\" and its burst.\n\nBefore explaining the Bank of Japan's views on these issues, I would like to emphasize that my talk today is not intended to draw specific conclusions or to assess the levels of stock prices and interest rates. This requires careful analysis and is an issue on which a central bank governor should refrain from comment. Rather, I would like to give you an idea of how the Bank examines these issues.\n\n## B. Effects of Fiscal Tightening\n\nThe first issue that I would like to discuss is the influence of fiscal tightening --such as reduction in public-sector investment, rise in the consumption tax rate, and termination of special tax reduction --on the economy for the next fiscal year.\n\nPublic-sector investment began to decline in autumn 1996, after having continued to expand until mid-1996 as a result of the economic measures introduced in autumn 1995. Although there may be a slight temporary increase in public-sector investment reflecting the implementation of the supplementary budget for the current fiscal year, the declining trend is expected to continue for some time. In addition, an increase in the consumption tax rate and the termination of the special tax reduction is scheduled for fiscal 1997.\n\nIt is important to mention here that the influence of fiscal tightening on the economy may vary significantly depending on the prevailing economic conditions, such as corporate profits and employment income development, as well as on the confidence that the corporate and household sectors have in the economy. Furthermore, this influence can differ substantially depending on how the public's expectations of the future economy change in response to reduced fiscal expenditures and tax increases, and how market interest rates respond to any reduction in the budget deficit.\n\nThe effects on the economy of a reduction of public-sector investment or a budget deficit have been debated by academics. The simplest Keynesian view is that reduced public-sector investment cumulatively acts to restrain private demand through multiplier effects. Some argue that a decrease in the budget deficit will lower interest rates and the yen's foreign exchange value, thus offsetting the negative effects on the economy. Some even hold that because the public behave rationally with anticipation of future tax increases or reductions, neither a decrease nor an increase in the budget deficit will have any effect on the economy.\n\nThe influence of a reduced budget deficit on the economy may thus be complex and diverse, once the movement of market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and the public's expectations are taken into account. It is natural to assume that in reality, the impact of reduced fiscal expenditures on the economy cannot be denied, although the influence is unlikely to reach the extent estimated by simply multiplying the nominal value of the reduction by a multiplier.\n\nTo underline the argument I just made, the economic mechanism does not work on the basis of simple addition and subtraction, but rather involves dynamic interactions of many factors which incorporates the public's expectations. After all, the effects of fiscal tightening are an empirical issue for which conclusions cannot be reached in advance, and therefore, it is very difficult to accurately predict future developments at this stage. Bearing this in mind, it is necessary to view carefully the effects of fiscal tightening on the economy as a whole.\n\n## C. Progress in the Structural Adjustment of Industries\n\nLet me now turn to the next issue of the structural adjustment of industries, which is a mediumto long-term issue for the Japanese economy.\n\nOne of the changes in the environment surrounding the Japanese economy in the past several years has been that a wider range of industries have come to face severe international competition due to the increasing supply capacity of other East Asian countries. The weakening of international competitiveness made it difficult for some industries and firms to continue domestic production of some of their conventional products. This forced them to relocate their production bases overseas while shifting their domestic production to new products for which they have a comparative advantage.\n\nThis is not the first time that the Japanese economy has faced structural adjustment pressures. In fact, it successfully confronted the challenge several times in the past. However, the adjustment this time has inevitably involved greater pains than in the past, due to the after-effects of the bursting of the economic \"bubble.\"\n\nFurthermore, as relocation overseas took place prior to a shift to new products, structural adjustment significantly constrained domestic production and, as a result, investment and employment were also limited. The negative impact was particularly substantial for the smaller firms, as many of them manufactured labor-intensive products and were subcontractors to the large firms which relocated their production bases overseas.\n\nThe key factors we should keep in mind in projecting future developments in the Japanese economy are therefore the progress in the structural adjustment of industries, that is, the emergence of new products or industries that will promote future economic growth.\n\nA careful look at individual industries reveals some positive signs. In production, for example, an increasing number of firms and industries are shifting to goods with international competitiveness. More specifically, the production of producer goods and capital goods that are capital-intensive and technology-intensive has been increasing while the production of labor-intensive consumer goods has been declining. These changes are also reflected in imports and exports of goods. Recently, exports of consumer goods, mainly household electric appliances such as television sets and radios, have been decreasing while their imports have been increasing, and exports of capital goods and parts such as electronic machinery and automobile parts have been increasing significantly.\n\nNotable as these changes may be, one cannot simply add up these microeconomic developments to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of how successfully the Japanese economy as a whole is undergoing the structural adjustment of industries. Rather, the progress in structural adjustment should be reflected most evidently in the revitalization of forward-looking business activity. If this were the case, the stance taken by firms toward fixed investment and employment should provide a measure of the progress in macroeconomic structural adjustment.\n\nIn this respect, business fixed investment by large firms began to recover in fiscal 1995 well ahead of small and medium-sized firms. Investment by smaller firms, which had been more susceptible to structural adjustment pressures, has also finally begun to show a recovery. Although the recovery is extremely moderate, this resumption of investment by smaller firms, an activity that lays the foundation for the future, may be considered as evidence of progress in\n\nstructural adjustment as it indicates that these firms are starting to have a clear idea about the new direction of their business.\n\nProgress is also reflected in the business fixed investment of various industries. Namely, investment has been increasing in capitaland production-goods related sectors, where high growth in production has been recorded. There has also been a rapid expansion of investment in a new industry of mobile telecommunications. Business fixed investment for development of new products and new businesses also seems to be increasing gradually.\n\nWith regard to employment, structural adjustment pressures are persistent in some indicators such as the high unemployment rate. However, based on the most recent changes in employment indicators and the microeconomic information on firms, labor market conditions are seen to be improving gradually, indicating steady progress in industrial restructuring.\n\nFor example, recent numbers of new job offers are significantly higher than those in the previous year. Business surveys indicate that an increasing number of firms plan, for the first time in many years, to increase the number of new graduates hired in the next fiscal year. Results of the November TANKAN also indicate that more than half of the smaller firms surveyed feel that they are shorthanded. Furthermore, labor market conditions in each sector indicate that employment has decreased significantly in sectors where imports have been making inroads --such as the electrical machinery and textiles industries --while employment has increased in new sectors such as telecommunications. These changes indicate a gradual shift of labor between sectors.\n\nIn sum, although pressures for the structural adjustment of industries remain, it can be said that structural adjustment has progressed significantly as reflected in the recent recovery in business fixed investment and employment.\n\n## D. Balance-Sheet Adjustment\n\nThe third issue to be discussed is that of balance-sheet adjustment. There are two aspects to this issue: the improvement of the financial condition of firms and the disposal of nonperforming loans of financial institutions.\n\nWith regard to the balance-sheet adjustment of Japanese firms, there have been serious efforts by firms to reduce their liabilities since the bursting of the economic \"bubble.\" Despite these efforts, the mismatch between assets and liabilities expanded in many sectors until 1994 or 1995 due to the continued decline in real estate prices. While the decline in asset prices has slowed since 1995, liabilities have decreased owing to the recovery in corporate profits which followed firms' restructuring efforts and lower interest rates.\n\nSeveral indicators, such as the ratio of long-term debts to assets at market value, reveal that balance-sheet adjustment pressures are persistent. In particular, small and medium-sized firms still need to make substantial efforts to complete their adjustment. As I have just mentioned, however, the improvement of firms' balance sheets has doubtlessly been making moderate but steady progress in general, and thus, constraints imposed by the adjustment pressures on economic recovery should continue to be gradually alleviated.\n\nRegarding the nonperforming-loan problem of financial institutions, the total amount of nonperforming loans of the financial institutions was approximately 29 trillion yen as of the end of September 1996, according to the data published by the Ministry of Finance. Of\n\nthis total, the estimated amount of problem loans to be disposed of, not including those already covered by collateral and provisions, is estimated at approximately 7 trillion yen. Both of these figures have decreased by approximately 10 trillion yen from the previous year, and thus, in general, it can be said that steady progress has been made in solving this particular problem.\n\nThe amount of nonperforming loans that need to be disposed of, however, remains large. The Bank of Japan will continue to strongly encourage financial institutions to dispose of the remaining nonperforming loans expeditiously and to exert themselves to the utmost to (1) restore their capital bases which have been impaired in the process of disposing of nonperforming loans; (2) strengthen their profitability through restructuring; and (3) enhance their internal risk management.\n\nIn relation to the economy, an issue of concern is whether the decline in the intermediary functions of those financial institutions burdened with nonperforming loans is constraining economic recovery. While it may certainly be true that financial institutions have imposed stricter screening criteria for lending following the experiences of the economic \"bubble\" period, most financial institutions now maintain a policy of actively increasing loans of reliable quality while, or rather for the purpose of, disposing of nonperforming loans. In fact, the lending attitude of financial institutions, as seen from the point of view of the firms, has become less severe and lending rates have stayed at a historically low level. It is, therefore, difficult to assume that the severer lending attitude of the financial institutions is hampering the recovery in business fixed investment.\n\n## IV. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Management\n\n## A. Economic Outlook\n\nI have so far discussed such issues as the effects of fiscal tightening and the current situation of structural adjustment, both considered to be the major factors contributing to the cautious economic outlook in financial markets. Among these, developments of structural adjustment may be summarized as follows: (1) both the structural adjustment of industries and balance-sheet adjustment are still in progress and therefore the pace of economic recovery is likely to remain moderate for some time; (2) however, as industrial restructuring and balancesheet adjustment are making steady progress, albeit moderate, its constraining effects on economic recovery are likely to gradually ease.\n\nTherefore, the most important issue in considering the economic outlook is whether the increase in private demand can overcome the downward pressures from fiscal tightening and whether it is possible, as a result, to lead the economy on to a path of selfsustained recovery.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, economic recovery has been recently gaining strength. If this recovery is analyzed in terms of the level of economic activity, namely the output gap, it can be noted that capacity utilization has been rising steadily reflecting the recent recovery in production, and has recovered to the same level as that of four years ago. Furthermore, the results of the November TANKAN indicated that the excessive production capacity and employment perceived by surveyed firms have gradually fallen to the same level as in 1987, at which time the economy was recovering from the recession caused by the appreciation of the yen. While the profit-to-sales ratio of smaller firms has not yet recovered to the average level of the past, the ratio of large firms has already reached a relatively high level. Judging overall, it\n\ncan be said that the current level of economic activity in Japan is approaching the same point where the strength of the recovery began to firm in past business cycles.\n\nThis level of economic activity will provide a basis for the virtuous circle of the economy, one that is led by expanded private demand, to gain further strength. In other words, if the recent economic recovery continues for some time, increased production will further improve corporate profits and employment income, which in turn are likely to lead to increases in business fixed investment and personal consumption. If this virtuous circle gains stronger momentum, there will be a higher possibility of the strengthened virtuous circle absorbing the downward pressures from prospective fiscal tightening.\n\nA temporary slowdown in economic recovery seems inevitable as downward pressures from fiscal tightening will be strong during the first half of fiscal 1997 and as a reaction to the increase in demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate scheduled for April 1997 is expected. However, the recovery trend of the economy is likely to be sustained on account of the strengthening recovery in private demand.\n\nI indicated earlier, however, that it is necessary to consider the effects of fiscal tightening carefully. Business sentiment and consumer confidence are also becoming important factors for a further increase in private demand. The corporate and household sectors will plan their activities and put them into action in the form of production, investment, and consumption, taking into account the fiscal 1997 budget and the actual placement of public work orders. Therefore, in predicting future economic developments, it is important to closely examine various macroand micro-economic data and not only the economic indicators that will be released in the future, but also firms' business plans and signals sent by financial markets.\n\nMeanwhile, it is expected that prices will cease to decline due firstly to the rise in import prices reflecting the yen's depreciation and higher crude oil prices, and secondly to the improvement in domestic supply and demand conditions. However, when considering the fact that the improvement in supply and demand conditions is expected to be moderate for now and that the pressures of global competition will persist, there is only a limited possibility that domestic prices will follow a clear upward trend. Yet, as foreign exchange rates have recently shown rather rapid movements, it is necessary to cautiously monitor the effects of such a development on the domestic economy.\n\nWhile refraining from making any comments on the recent foreign exchange rate levels and movements, the Bank's fundamental thinking is that it is desirable for exchange rates to be stable and determined in accordance with the real economic conditions of each country. Based on this thinking, the Bank of Japan will continue to carefully monitor foreign exchange rate developments and their effects on the Japanese economy.\n\n## B. Monetary Policy Management\n\nIn the management of current monetary policy, the Bank of Japan will continue to monitor economic developments closely, placing emphasis on further strengthening the foundation of an economic recovery.\n\nIn April 1997, the consumption tax rate will be raised from 3 percent to 5 percent. Therefore, I would also like to discuss how the Bank of Japan views the possible effects of this tax rate rise on prices, in the context of managing monetary policy. Specifically, the issue here is\n\nwhat monetary policy measures should be taken in light of the price hikes due to the rise in the tax rate.\n\nI would first like to point out that the price hikes caused by the rise in the consumption tax rate is different in nature from the ordinary rise in prices, that is inflation. Generally, inflation is generated in the mechanism of economic cycles as a result of, for example, tightening of supply and demand conditions for labor or products, or excessive supply of money. In turn, inflation affects economic activity in various ways.\n\nIn contrast, price hikes due to a rise in the consumption tax rate are equivalent to a once only rewriting of all the old price tags on April 1. There are no relevant changes in economic activity, such as a tightening of supply and demand conditions, an increase in wages, or excessive money supply. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to formulate monetary policy against such superficial changes in prices.\n\nAlthough this represents the fundamental thinking of the Bank, it does not mean that the central bank is indifferent to the rise in the consumption tax rate. If the rise triggers price hikes taking advantage of the tax rate rise, or if overall inflationary expectations are heightened, then the risk of a genuine inflation will arise. In particular, this risk cannot be disregarded when the supply and demand conditions for products are fairly tight. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the inflationary expectations and possible over-reactions caused by the rise in the consumption tax rate rather than paying attention to the previously-mentioned superficial hikes in prices.\n\nIn summary, in order to promote a smooth structural adjustment, to bring about a strengthening of the economic recovery, and to encourage the renewed development of the Japanese economy, the implementation of a drastic structural reform, including effective deregulation, is indispensable. In this respect, I hope that the government will continue to exercise strong leadership and earnest efforts will continue to be made by various parties.\n\n## V. Financial System Reform and Revision of the Bank of Japan Law\n\n## A. Financial System Reform\n\nI would like to use the remaining time to discuss financial system reform and the revision of the Bank of Japan Law.\n\nThe important challenge for Japan today is to vigorously promote structural reform as discussed above, and this also applies to the reform of the financial markets and of the financial system.\n\nFinancial markets worldwide have experienced significant changes in recent years amid rapid financial and economic globalization and technological innovation. New financial instruments such as derivatives and securitized products have been developed in succession to provide firms and households with diverse means of risk-hedging, investment, and financing. At the same time, profit opportunities for financial institutions have expanded in various fields.\n\nIt seems that it is now time for the market participants to select the market, rather than the markets selecting the participants. Countries are vying with each other to reform their financial markets, based on a growing worldwide perception that the financial services sector\n\nwill show rapid growth and create numerous employment opportunities into the twenty-first century. Each country is thus striving to make their own markets attractive to participants.\n\nJapan, too, has engaged in the review of regulations and systems to promote financial deregulation. However, reform has been gradual and financial institutions have tended to deal with it cautiously due to the severe challenge they have had to face after the bursting of the economic \"bubble.\" As a result, the Tokyo market has fallen far behind the New York and London markets in terms of its ability to develop financial instruments that incorporate new techniques.\n\nIn recognition of this, Prime Minister Hashimoto proposed the \"Big Bang\" deregulation package for Japan. I understand that the purpose of this financial reform package is to revitalize the Tokyo market as a free and active global market. The Bank believes that the aims of this reform package are most appropriate and as a central bank, intends to contribute to the achievement of its goals.\n\nIn carrying out the reform, it is especially important that the three basic principles of freedom, fairness, and globalization are strictly followed, and that the pace of the reform is not relaxed. The \"Big Bang\" package aims to realize and complete all reforms by the year 2001, immediately implementing any measures on which study has been concluded. However, this should not mean that the process of market reform become unduly gradual or slow, as this may jeopardize the consistency of the reform, or result in only an easier part of the reform being implemented.\n\nFor example, one deregulation measure included in the \"Big Bang\" package and highly valued by the Bank is the fundamental revision of the Foreign Exchange Control Law. If deregulation in other areas proceeds too slowly, the effects of the new Foreign Exchange Control Law might encourage financial transactions to shift to overseas markets and might then lead to the hollowing-out of the Tokyo market. In order to avoid such a turn of events, it is most important to bring about concrete measures within the shortest possible time to maintain the coherence of the deregulation as a whole.\n\n## B. Revision of the Bank of Japan Law\n\nLastly, I would like to discuss the revision of the Bank of Japan Law.\n\nThe revision of the Bank of Japan Law is now in the final stage of deliberation by the Financial System Research Council, an advisory committee to the Minister of Finance, following discussions last year by the Central Bank Study Group, an advisory panel to the Prime Minister.\n\nThe Bank has made public its views on the Bank of Japan Law revision at a press conference held at the end of 1996 and on other occasions. To summarize, (1) the Bank holds that the basic views stated by the Central Bank Study Group --that is, ensuring central bank independence and enhancing transparency --should be clearly stated in the law; and (2) the Bank believes that further deliberations should be conducted on several issues regarding the relationship between the government and the central bank, on which the Central Bank Study Group was unable to reach conclusions, so as to duly reflect the two concepts of independence and transparency.\n\nFortunately, the Bank's views appear to be adequately shared by the members of the Financial System Research Council. I would therefore like to discuss today the significance of the revision of the Bank of Japan Law to the Japanese economy as a whole.\n\nFirst, this revision of the central bank system is a response to the global trend of changes, including financial and economic globalization and marketization, which have been driven by progress in financial innovation.\n\nOn various occasions in the past, I have discussed how in the new financial environment, markets around the world respond instantaneously to various information and they also respond to changes in the expectations of market participants as the participants process such information. The \"Big Bang\" package is likely to promote this tendency through increased efficiency and globalization of the markets. Under such circumstances, if the role and responsibility of the central bank in charge of monetary policy management are not made clear, or if both domestic and overseas understanding of the central bank's monetary policy management is insufficient, a country's monetary policy intentions may not permeate sufficiently throughout the market. In addition, irrelevant information may disrupt the markets.\n\nThe idea of entrusting the responsibility of ensuring price stability with the central bank, an establishment detached from short-term interests, is a wisdom acquired from the history of battles against inflation. The recent strengthening of central bank independence and the growing demand for transparency of monetary policy management around the world reflect the stronger emphasis on the status and responsibility of central banks to meet the new challenges presented by the global changes in the financial markets.\n\nSecond, in order for the financial markets or the financial system of a country to function efficiently and stably, appropriate policy and operational management by the central bank, which rests at the core of the financial system, is indispensable.\n\nThe Japanese financial system is a mechanism for intermediating savings and investments by the efficient allocation of funds by means of a currency called the \"yen.\" In order for this mechanism to function properly, (1) the value of money --in other words, domestic prices --must be stable; (2) the mechanism for settling transactions by means of money must be efficient and convenient; and (3) private financial institutions, as the members of the financial system, as well as the central bank must be sound and reliable.\n\nThe maintenance of these three conditions --that is, price stability, stable operations of the payment and settlement systems, and the resulting soundness of the financial system --is the important responsibility of the central bank, an institution which has a primary role in the issuance and circulation of the \"yen.\" The central bank system is thus an important component of the financial system infrastructure of Japan.\n\nTherefore, in order to win domestic and overseas confidence in the Japanese financial markets and to maintain and improve the international competitiveness of these markets, it is essential that the central bank system is able to win domestic and overseas confidence, and that the market environment is improved through such efforts as the \"Big Bang\" reform package.\n\nThird, many of the issues raised regarding the revision of the Bank of Japan Law can also be applied to economic structural reform and to administrative reform in Japan.\n\nThe Bank of Japan has urged that (1) its organizational objectives and roles be clarified; and (2) the management of policy and operations be founded on a mechanism which allows the market participants and other third parties to monitor ex post facto whether the Bank is discharging its responsibility appropriately, rather than be part of a mechanism that attaches importance to advance coordination with the government.\n\nThis argument applies not only to the central bank. In fact, it may be applied generally to the question of what the economic and financial systems should be or what the role of government administration should take to meet the challenges of a new era.\n\nThe Japanese economy today is required to function within a mechanism under which any institution is responsible for its own course of action and then the market and the public examine and evaluate the actions taken, instead of within a system governed by advance examination based on administrative supervision and regulations.\n\nSuch reforms will fundamentally change the economic and social structures of Japan, making them more consistent with global standards. The old methodology of carrying out reforms within the conventional framework and ways of thinking must be changed. It is necessary to consider how the distinctive systems and ways of thinking in Japan could be changed from a perspective of global standards.\n\nThe issue of the revision of the Bank of Japan Law has drawn attention overseas along with the \"Big Bang\" package of financial reforms. This is because the revision of the Law is regarded as a test case of whether or not Japan can change itself.\n\nTo repeat my earlier point, the Bank of Japan strongly hopes that the two concepts put forward by the Central Bank Study Group --that is, ensuring central bank independence and enhancing transparency --will be clearly reflected in the revised Bank of Japan Law. I wish to make clear that the revision of the Law is not an issue that solely concerns the Bank of Japan, the monetary authorities, and the financial community, but is an issue closely related to the future course of the Japanese economy as a whole.\n\nIt is very important for the Bank of Japan to prove its ability to reform itself and to win domestic and overseas confidence through constant efforts toward appropriate policy and operational management. As part of such efforts, the Bank last year announced plans for the revision of policy and operational management, including the holding of regular meetings of the Policy Board for monetary policy decisions and the disclosure of the summary of those meetings. We at the Bank are determined to further promote vigorously institutional and operational reform.\n\nI would like to conclude by asking for your continued understanding and support. Iam most grateful for the kind attention you have given me today.",

         "BANK OF JAPAN, QUARTERLY BULLETIN, February 1997 (advance summary).",
         "Bank  of  Japan  presents  its  quarterly  economic  outlook  for  winter  1997 BANK OF JAPAN, QUARTERLY BULLETIN, February 1997 (advance summary).\n\n1. A  moderate  economic  recovery  continues  in  Japan  as  private  demand shows increasing firmness.  Among final demand items, public-sector investment has begun to decrease while net exports have started to rise.  Housing investment has remained at a high level and  business  fixed  investment  is  also  increasing  steadily.    While  the  increase  in  personal consumption has been moderate on the whole, passenger car sales have recently increased at a faster pace.  Meanwhile, inventories are generally at appropriate levels.  In these circumstances, industrial production is increasing and recently, in particular, the pace of growth has accelerated to some extent.  Labor market conditions have continued to improve moderately.\n\nPrices have stopped declining on the whole.  Domestic wholesale prices (adjusted for seasonal electricity  rates)  have  almost  stopped  declining,  reflecting  the  depreciation  of  the yen and the rise in oil prices to date as well as the moderate improvement in domestic supply and  demand  conditions,  particularly  in  construction  goods.    The  year-to-year  decline  in corporate  service  prices  is  narrowing  gradually.    Consumer  prices  (nationwide,  excluding perishables) are marginally above the previous year's level.  Land prices continue to weaken on the whole, but there are some signs of improvement in the supply and demand conditions.  On the balance of payments, the real trade surplus has recently started to increase and the nominal current account surplus is also rising moderately.\n\n2. In  the  financial  markets,  the  overnight  call  rate  (uncollateralized)  has stayed  slightly  below  the  official  discount  rate,  and  the  3-month  CD  rate  has  remained  at 0.50 - 0.55  per  cent  since  autumn  1996.    The  long-term  government  bond  yield  has  been declining since July 1996, and it marked a record low of 2.3 - 2.4 per cent in early December and has recently remained at around 2.4 per cent.  Stock prices have declined substantially since the end of 1996.  The yen has been depreciating since the end of 1996, particularly against the U.S. dollar.\n\nMeanwhile, growth in lending by private financial institutions has continued to be slow, owing both to weak corporate demand for new funds and to an increase in capital market financing.    Monetary  aggregates  in  terms  of  M2  +  CDs  average  outstanding,  however,  have continued to grow at over 3.0 per cent.\n\n3. To  gauge  future  developments  of  Japan's  economy  in  the  context  of individual  components  of  final  demand,  public-sector  investment  is  expected  to  show  further declines  in  the  coming  months.    Net  exports  are  likely  to  continue  to  increase  for  some  time despite  the  increase  in  imports  caused  by  structural  factors,  as  the  effects  of  the  yen's depreciation since 1995 manifest themselves.\n\nAs for the growth momentum of domestic private demand, corporate profits are increasing  reflecting such factors as the depreciation of the yen and the rise in production.  The recovery  in  corporate  profits  is  gradually  spreading  to  the  whole  corporate  sector,  including small firms.  Reflecting conditions conducive to business fixed investment, such as the increase in corporate profits and progress in capital stock adjustments, business fixed investment on the whole  is  expected  to  continue  a  steady  recovery  for  some  time  despite  the  influence  of  the slowdown in the market expansion in the mobile telecommunications industry.  With respect to the  household  sector,  housing  investment  is  unlikely  to  show  significant  declines  under  the generally easy monetary conditions.  Personal consumption on average is expected to continue its moderate recovery, reflecting the rise in household incomes and strong demand in areas such\n\nas passenger cars and information-related products, although the consumption tax rate hike will exert some negative influences on consumption growth.\n\nHowever, growth in  business  fixed  investment  is  still  checked  as  balance-sheet adjustment pressures remain strong.  Also, the gains in household incomes are expected to be restrained to some extent as many firms still judge their work force to be excessive.\n\n4. Turning to the outlook on prices, the deceleration in the declining tempo is  expected  to  become  more  evident.    Factors  contributing  to  this  include  the  rise  in  import prices to date owing to the effects of the yen's depreciation and the rise in crude oil prices, as well  as  an  improvement  in  domestic  supply  and  demand  conditions.    However,  prices  are unlikely  to  follow  a  clear  upward  trend  for  some  time  because  of  the  modest  pace  of improvements  in  supply  and  demand  conditions  and  the  intense  global  competition,  but  the influence of the accelerated rise in import prices requires careful monitoring.\n5. In  sum,  recovery  in  private  demand  shows  increasing  firmness  with  a strengthened  virtuous  cycle  that  involves  production  growth.    Net  exports,  which  had  been exerting  a  downward  pressure  on  the  economy  until  the  middle  of  1996,  are  beginning  to support income formation mainly reflecting the yen's depreciation to date.  Considering that the restraining effects from fiscal policy on the economy are likely to strengthen, and that a setback in  demand  is  expected  following  the  surge  in  anticipation  of  the  consumption  tax  rate  hike, Japan's economic growth is expected to slow down temporarily in the first half of fiscal 1997. Judging from the above developments, however, the economic recovery on the whole will most likely continue in the future.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  there remain  factors,  such  as  balance-sheet  adjustment pressures, which tend to keep private demand from gaining strength.  Also, the influence of the recent  plunge  in  stock  prices  on  corporate  sentiment  requires  careful  scrutiny.    In  these circumstances,  it  is  essential  to  promote  necessary  adjustments  by  such  means  as  a  swift implementation  of  effective  reforms  in  Japan  s  economic  structure.  This  is  an  important ingredient in the efforts to strengthen the basis for medium-term growth in Japan's economy.",

         "Speech by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr. Lars Heikensten, at the Baker &amp;amp; McKenzie's EMU seminar held in Stockholm on 5/2/97.",
         "Mr. Heikensten looks at the consequences for Sweden of joining EMU Speech by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Sweden, Mr. Lars Heikensten, at the Baker &amp; McKenzie's EMU seminar held in Stockholm on 5/2/97.\n\nFirst a word of thanks for the invitation to talk with you about Sweden and the European Economic and Monetary Union. Today I have chosen to consider this matter from three angles: general aspects of the issue of Sweden and EMU; the work we did last year in the Union to prepare for EMU; and some consequences of EMU for Sweden's financial sector.\n\nThe EU's preparations for the economic and monetary union are continuing. The member states are doing all they can to fulfil the economic criteria for participation in the euro area. Along with this, intensive political work is being done to remove any remaining obstacles. After the latest meeting of Heads of State or of Government, in Dublin last December, political agreements are in place on, for example, the stability and growth pact and the relationship between the euro and outside currencies.\n\nSolutions are still required on a number of important issues. One is how the path into EMU is to be arranged for countries that do not belong to the first group. Then there are many technical details to adjust in the course of the year. But the puzzle's main pieces are now in place.\n\n## EMU -an important part in EU cooperation\n\nWhen asked about the likelihood of EMU being actually established on time, some observers declare that \"the EMU process has reached a point of no return\". I neither can nor want to be so categorical. But that EMU will be realised on time in accordance with the Treaty does seem highly probable. The political determination is strong, as has been demonstrated time and again when conflicting views threaten the process.\n\nI am glad the debate has now started in Sweden and that it is concentrating to a greater extent on the consequences for Sweden of joining the monetary union or remaining outside, rather than on whether the EMU project as such is good or bad. What I still lack in the debate is an appraisal of EMU in a broader policy perspective. The purpose of the economic and monetary union is the same as for the European Union: closer European cooperation on such areas as integration, growth, employment and prosperity.\n\nThe European Union is often discussed in Sweden in terms of a Brussels bureaucracy that deals with the length of cucumbers or the curve of bananas. That is of course both incorrect and unfortunate. The Union should be seen as an arena or, if you like, a playing field. For some years now Sweden has been a player, which involves learning the rules and taking initiatives for the development of Europe in concert with other countries. But this presupposes that, instead of again remaining outside, we participate in the contexts where developments are constructed.\n\n## Opportunities and risks\n\nThe idea behind a single currency in Europe is simple. One currency is better than many -it makes things work more efficiently. Eliminating the need to exchange currencies reduces transaction costs. The exchange rate stability facilitates trade and investment. A single currency makes price comparisons and economic estimates easier, not least for small and\n\nmedium-sized companies. More direct price comparisons should lead in turn to stronger competition and downward pressure on prices, to the benefit of consumers.\n\nBut risks are also involved when a single currency is introduced in so many countries with geographical, cultural and institutional differences. The Calmfors report has highlighted the insurance argument. I agree that this is an important point against EMU and therefore warrants particular attention. Monetary and exchange rate policy can be used as a kind of insurance against major, unforeseeable shocks in a single country. Without it, large adjustments may be required in other parts of the economy.\n\nHowever, when Calmfors and others claim that country-specific shocks have been more frequent in the Swedish economy than in the EU's core countries, they are on uncertain ground. There are many indications that the shocks in Sweden have been occasioned above all by domestic economic policy and other institutional conditions, in the labour market and in wage formation. Wage costs in Sweden rose considerably faster than in other countries in the 1970s and 1980s; competitiveness was restored by resorting to devaluations.\n\nIt is not self-evident that shocks generated externally would hit Sweden more seriously than countries which are currently taken as given for EMU. So the risk of what economists call asymmetric shocks in Sweden should not be exaggerated.\n\nMoreover, when it comes to influencing production and employment in the event of major shocks, monetary policy has a limited capability. It may even be the case that independence in monetary policy increases the risk of self-inflicted shocks. In the longer run, monetary policy is not a substitute for the changes that need to be made, for instance to improve wage formation and the workings of the labour market.\n\nThe Governing Board of the Riksbank will shortly be submitting an opinion on the Calmfors report. The arguments for and against EMU participation will be considered there at greater length. A general theme in the report is that every kind of decision -to joint now, to join later or to stay outside -entails risks and has a price. Although the report conclude that Sweden should wait joining EMU for the time being, not much is needed to tip the scales the other way, for example if EMU begins with more participants than the core countries or if the alternative of remaining outside does not confer any substantial freedom in monetary policy. But as I said, there will be occasion to return to this.\n\n## Preparatory work in the EU\n\nThe preparatory work is in full swing in all the EU institutions as well as in the member states. The EMU project will not founder on technical aspects.\n\nIn May 1995 the Commission presented a green paper on the practical arrangements for a changeover to the single currency. At the Madrid meeting that year the European Council adopted the scenario for the changeover, specifying dates for the central decisions. The Council confirmed that Stage Three of EMU is to start on Ist January 1999. The decision on which countries will participate in the euro area is to be made as early as possible in 1998 (probably February--April) on the basis of which countries fulfil the convergence criteria in respect of statistics for 1997. Euro banknotes and coins are to be in circulation by January 2002 at the latest.\n\nThe preparatory work last year was dominated by two issues: one was what is now called the growth and stability pact and the other was the nature of the relationship between the euro and the currencies outside the euro area. A common factor in these matters is the question of maintaining stability once EMU has been established.\n\n## 1. Growth and stability pact\n\nWithout specific restrictions, participation in the euro area would make it easier for a country to implement an expansionary budget policy. When national currencies disappear and the interest rate largely reflects the single monetary policy, some of the immediate signals to politicians and other decision-makers will disappear. Access to the large, uniform capital market that will result from EMU will also make it easier to borrow. Up to a point, of course, this is good; it eases the tax burden in countries with a large government debt, for example. But it also involves risks, above all that a country abuses the situation so that ultimately it is other countries which may have to pay when failure threatens.\n\nThe Maastricht Treaty, as most people probably know by now, contains a number of conditions that member states have to fulfil in order to participate in the euro area. Once countries have joined the euro area, however, there are no correspondingly strict rules. This is where the growth and stability pact comes in.\n\nThe purpose of the pact is to get participating countries to strive for a cyclically balanced budget or a surplus position. Deviations from this target are to trigger alarm signals whereby the Council starts to take action in the form of examinations, advice, recommendations, publication and, ultimately, sanctions. The monitoring of economic development in member states is to be reinforced with a mandatory stability programme, similar to the present convergence programme. In the event of a country having an excessively large budget deficit, its government must act. If adequate measures have not been taken within ten months, the country will be required to deposit a no-interest fee with the EU Commission. If the deficit is still excessive after two years, the fee is transformed into a fine. At most the fine can amount to the equivalent of 0.5 per cent of GDP.\n\nIf the deficit is due to exceptional circumstances, sanctions are not to be imposed. If GDP falls by 2 per cent, no sanctions are to be levied for an excessively large budget deficit. The Council can also decide not to impose sanctions if GDP falls by between 0.75 and 2 per cent and other \"special circumstances\" apply.\n\nWhile the point of a system for preventing the abuse of fiscal policy in EMU has always been clear, one cannot turn a blind eye to the risks inherent in rules such as those in the stability pact. It is thus a matter of striking a reasonable balance between different interests, which is why the discussion has been so protracted. The risks are mainly of two kinds:\n\n- -One has to do with the need of adjustment mechanisms. With no possibility of using monetary and exchange rate policy at the national level, it may be important for the system to provide other \"buffers\". Therefore the pact ought not to be so strict that it might in practice have a destabilising effect in a particular country with problems.\n- -The other concerns credibility. What would happen if the threat of sanctions fails to act as a deterrent? Will the European political system be capable of punishing a member state?\n\nThe main features of the growth and stability pact have been established. It remains to draw up specific rules about, for example, the monitoring of exchange rate stability, the construction of the stability programme and the legal framework. Finally it may be worth mentioning that the monitoring routine and the excessive deficit procedure will be essentially the same for countries outside the euro area, except in one respect -the sanctions.\n\n## 2. ERM 2\n\nThe Dublin meeting also decided that a new exchange rate arrangement, ERM 2, is to be set up as the dominant mechanism for the coordination of monetary policy and other economic policies between the member states in the euro area and those that remain outside. The system will resemble the existing ERM except that this is a multilateral system of rates for conversion between all the member currencies, while in ERM 2 the currencies of nonparticipating countries will be linked directly to the euro.\n\nThe risk of systemic tensions with ERM 2 will probably be smaller than it has been earlier with ERM because the degree of convergence in the EU area is now greater. Moreover, the band on either side of the central rates will probably be relatively broad. The experience gained in 1992-93 has also resulted in a greater readiness to adjust rates when this is considered necessary. But of course speculative situations cannot be ruled out either in the present ERM or in ERM 2, as is clear from developments in Finland in recent months.\n\nThe Swedish position has been to avoid making the new exchange rate arrangement mandatory. Basically, we consider it would be better to achieve coordination in Europe with a single inflation target. We find the present construction of Swedish monetary policy satisfactory. But we can get along with the system that has been chosen. Cooperation will not be mandatory, which means that monetary policy can be conducted with an inflation target as well as with a fixed exchange rate with the euro. Still it is clear that there will be strong pressure on us to participate in ERM 2. It is also conceivable that a period of participation in the exchange rate mechanism will prove to be a condition for EMU membership. In any event, as a EU member state we have undertaken to conduct exchange rate policy as \"a matter of common interest\".\n\n## Changeover plan for the financial sector\n\nIt is the Riksdag (Sweden's parliament) that decides if Sweden should join EMU. The Riksbank has the task of helping to ensure that Sweden does in fact have a choice when the time comes to decide, so that Sweden is ready to join if a Riksdag majority so requires.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance and the Riksbank each have an organisation for the euro's practical introduction. The scale of the systemic changeover is tremendous, roughly on a par with our earlier change to driving on the right-hand side of the road. A fundamental principle for the work is that, as far as possible, all those concerned are to find their own solutions to the problems posed by EMU.\n\nThe Riksbank is responsible for the changeover in the financial sector. To this end we have set up a body called SIFS (the Swedish acronym for Consultation and Information to the Financial Sector). One result to date is a report, published a few days ago, on the situation as regards the euro in Sweden's financial sector.\n\nGood progress has been made in the preparatory work. Timetables and suitable solutions have been established in a number of fields. The Riksbank considers that the financial\n\nsector can manage a changeover to the euro on Ist January 1999. Participation from a later date can facilitate the preparatory work in certain respects and complicate it in others. The worst alternative is a long period of uncertainty; that would entail a costly duplication of systems in many fields.\n\nI should like to end with some examples of changes that will occur and be of importance for the financial markets.\n\n## 1. Monetary policy\n\nA single currency presupposes a single monetary policy. In EMU this will be implemented by the ECB. In this context the national central banks will function as \"operative arms\", acting on instructions from the ECB.\n\nFor Swedish banks and financial institutions, the difference as regards participation in central bank monetary policy operations will probably not be all that great. The Riksbank will no doubt continue to be the financial sector's counterparty. The main differences from today for Swedish banks are that the overnight market will be considerably larger and that minimum reserves are likely to be required.\n\nHow monetary policy is to be constructed and implemented in detail has still to be decided. These matters will not be finalised until the ECB has been established next year. Thus it is the countries which participate from the start that will be in a position to influence the conduct of policy as well as the organisation of the work in the new European bank. There are already tendencies for countries belonging to the \"presumed\" core to exercise a greater influence over the process.\n\n## 2. Payment system\n\nA single monetary policy calls in turn for a common payment system in order to handle the payments connected with the policy's implementation. The arrangements whereby all the national systems are interlinked is called the Target system.\n\nIn the new system, a cross-border payment will normally be made in a matter of seconds, whereas at present in the best case it takes a whole day. The main objective of Target is to enable the ECB to implement monetary policy but the new system will also provide a new \"highway\" for commercial transactions. The extent to which banks and other enterprises use the system will probably depend on the price.\n\nAll the national central banks in the EU area can join Target, whether or not their country is in the euro area. But there is a considerable risk of countries outside the euro area being in a worse position, for instance due to restrictions on intra-day borrowing in euro to counter fluctuations in the payment flows. We have vigorously opposed this threat of discrimination but the issue, along with others, has been deferred and will now be decided by the countries that join the euro area from the start.\n\n## 3. Legal framework\n\nA clear legal framework for the euro is essential. Economic values, for instance in contracts, bank accounts and pension agreements, must be guaranteed during the changeover period from 1999 to 2002, when the euro and national currencies will exist side by side. The so-\n\ncalled continuity of contracts is regulated in one of the euro statutes but amendments to national laws will also be needed.\n\nAnother legal issue concerns the national central banks. As regards the Riksbank, the Maastricht Treaty calls for a more independent statutory status. This means, for instance, that the status of the Governor must be clarified; grounds for his or her dismissal will have to be explicit, e.g. serious misconduct, etc. Neither will the Riksbank be able to accept directives, except of a statutory nature, from others, e.g. the Government. The composition of the Governing Board may be a problem; the appointment of members of Parliament to the Governing Board runs counter to traditions in Central Europe.\n\n## 4. Debt conversion and issues\n\nThe countries that join the euro area may -and it is also envisaged that they will -issue treasury paper denominated in euro. A member state wishing to convert its stock of debt into euro will be allowed to initiate the appropriate measures. A member state may also take steps whereby private issuers and marketplaces (e.g. the Stockholm Stock Exchange, OM and the Securities Register Centre) can switch to euro in the changeover period. Many institutions and agents are in fact planning to do this.\n\nAll private economic agents are to be free to choose between using euro from the start of Stage Three and waiting until the changeover has been completed. However, the agents in the Swedish securities market, banks, financial institutions, the Securities Register Centre, the Stockholm Stock Exchange, OM and others are unanimously in favour of a \"big-bang\" solution, that is, a quick, concerted changeover from kronor to euro right from the turn of 1998.\n\n## 5. Banknotes and coins\n\nEuro banknotes and coins will not be introduced until the beginning of 2002. For a time, commerce will have to cope with two sets of prices, one in krona and the other in euro. A timetable for the substitution of banknotes and coins is to be fixed by each country. For Sweden the Riksbank hopes that the changeover can be arranged in an appreciably shorter time than the allotted six months.\n\nIt should be underscored, finally, that EMU is likely to bring about notable changes in the financial landscape. Some products will simply disappear: currencies, as well as forward and option instruments derived from them. With a single monetary policy and no exchange risk, interest rate differentials between national treasury papers will arise only from credit risk. The market for Swedish treasury paper will be more or less integrated in a market for treasury paper in euro. Provided the debt situation in the countries concerned is under control and reasonably similar, national T-bonds will become close substitutes. That will also do away with a number of national forward and option products.\n\nCertainly there will be new financial products; there has been no lack of creativity in this field in the past decade. There will clearly be increased competition between financial institutions as well as between financial markets in different locations.\n\nThere is nothing new about the globalisation and integration of the world's financial markets but it is reasonable to suppose that EMU will accelerate the process.\n\n## Summary and conclusions\n\nToday it looks for the most part as though economic and monetary union will start as planned on Ist January 1999. For Sweden the question is whether we are to participate from the start, wait a while or try to remain outside for ever. Recently the discussion of this issue has finally got going. My view has been that it is not just a question of economics, though the economic arguments do point to participation. EMU is one important component of the EU cooperation in which Sweden is now taking part.\n\nFrom the debate about economic aspects of EMU one sometimes gets the impression that an alternative exists which is much simpler, enabling us to avoid all the adjustments which Brussels imposes. That is not the case. Sweden has experienced a profound economic crisis in the 1990s that was essentially self-inflicted. Development in the rest of Europe has on the whole been better. We must now in any event continue to consolidate government finance and establish long-term confidence in the stability of Swedish economy. This will scarcely be easier outside EMU.\n\nI find it hard to envisage that Sweden would ultimately want to remain outside a functional EMU. Bit by bit the countries of Europe will grow together. This makes the question not whether but when Sweden ought to join. Perhaps this perspective can help to make the question less dramatic.\n\nIn our efforts to prepare the financial sector for EMU we can see that the work has come a long way. We also meet a strong desire from the parties concerned to get going as quickly as possible so as not to fall behind; so as to compete on the same terms as other European enterprises and not lose business opportunities.\n\nMy own experience of EU cooperation prompts the same conclusion. As a \"free rider\" alongside EMU it is not just business opportunities that we lose but also influence on European cooperation.",

         "Mr. Lamfalussy looks at the progress achieved by the Hungarian economy in recent years  (Central Bank Articles and Speeches, 7 Feb 97)",
         "Address by the President of the European Monetary Institute, Mr. Alexandre Lamfalussy, at a conference organised by the Hungarian Banking Association on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the new Hungarian banking system and held in Budapest on 7/2/97.",
         "Mr. Lamfalussy looks at the progress achieved by the Hungarian economy in recent  years Address  by  the  President  of  the  European  Monetary  Institute,  Mr.  Alexandre Lamfalussy, at a conference organised by the Hungarian Banking Association on the occasion of the  10th  anniversary  of  the  establishment  of  the  new  Hungarian  banking  system  and  held  in Budapest on 7/2/97.\n\nFor at  least  three  reasons,  I  have  accepted  with  pleasure  the  invitation  to  share some thoughts with you on the occasion of these tenth anniversary celebrations.\n\nFirst, for obvious personal reasons, I enjoy spending some time in Hungary - even if it is only for less than a day.\n\nSecond, I am absolutely convinced that an efficient financial system in general, and an efficient banking system in particular, together comprise an indispensable precondition for  the  proper  functioning  of  a  market  economy  and,  indeed,  for  economic  growth.  Not  a sufficient condition, but a necessary one.\n\nThird, I note that Hungary has made substantial progress in this direction in four key areas. The larger part of the Hungarian banking system is now in genuinely private hands; the financial health of most banks (which, not so long ago, was - to put it mildly - precarious) has improved; the legal, accounting and regulatory framework has been consolidated, and, last but  not  least,  there  is  now  an  interbank  payment  system  in  place  which  can  no  longer  be qualified as prehistoric. Admittedly, in all these areas progress is still possible and desirable, but what has been achieved so far now enables you to address a number of institutional issues for the solution of which Western experience is fast becoming increasingly and directly relevant.\n\nBut  before  considering  some  of  these  issues,  allow  me  to  make  some  remarks about  the  macroeconomic  situation  of  the  Hungarian  economy  and  about  the  new  framework within  which  the  National  Bank  of  Hungary  will  be  operating.  Both  these  areas  are  of  key importance  for  the  management  of  your  banks.  At  the  same  time,  both  have  a  bearing  on Hungary's declared intention to join the European Union (and within this, probably at  a  later stage,  also  EMU).  Last  but  not  least,  both  are  important  areas  in  themselves,  irrespective  of considerations relating to European integration.\n\n## THE MACROECONOMIC SITUATION\n\nThat  there  has  been  a  significant  improvement  since  mid-1995  in  Hungary's macroeconomic situation is beyond doubt. Here are a few facts and comments on some of the features of this improvement.\n\n1. The current account deficit reached $3.5 billion in 1993 and almost $4 billion in 1994, i.e. more than 10% of GDP - an obviously unsustainable situation by any standards, but even more so for a country with a high debt ratio. Some of this deficit was covered by direct foreign investment, but the greater part of it was financed by borrowing, as a result of which by the end of 1994 the net external debt had reached 46% of GDP and the exceptionally high level of more than 160% of exports of goods and services and unrequited transfers.\n2. I have not yet seen the full 1996 figures, but estimates based on the first eleven months suggest a current account deficit of around (or even less than) $1.5 billion. This looks much more reasonable, not only because it was more than covered by foreign direct investment but  also  because  of  what  lies  behind  this  improvement.  The  $2.5  billion  drop  in  the  current\n\naccount deficit  between 1994  and  1996  was  made  possible  (a)  by  a  35%  increase  in  exports, accompanied by a modest increase in imports of about  14%,  and  (b)  by  the  steady  and  rapid increase in services income, mainly (but not exclusively) derived from tourism.\n\n3. Since there was also a sizable inflow of foreign direct investment in 1995 and 1996,  the  country's  net  external  debt  dropped  from  $18.9  billion  at  end-1994  to  about  $13.3 billion at end-1996. Net external debt declined to 31.2 expressed as a percentage of GDP, and to 71.6 as a percentage of exports of goods, services and unrequited transfers. I have also noted that by 1996 net interest payments on the external debt had dropped to 6.7 as a percentage of exports of goods and services. The comparable figures were 12% in 1994 and as high as 17% in 1990. It is useful to point out that the sizeable decline of the net external debt was made possible by the substantial decline of the public sector  deficit from 8.2% of GDP in 1994 to 4% in 1996, while at  the  same time the share of public sector expenditure in GDP declined from 62% to a more bearable  51%.  'Growing  out'  of  the  debt  service  burden  is  no  longer  wishful  thinking.  It  is beginning to become a reality.\n\n4.  The  fact  I  find  most  noteworthy  is  that  the  $2.5  billion  switch  of  resources towards external use, amounting to some 7% of GDP, took place without a recession, which is unusual  for  such  a  large  switch.  It  was  even  accompanied  by  a  small  increase  in  GDP.  This would not  have  been  possible  without  the  fast  growth  of  exports.  The  remarkable  growth  of labour productivity in industry - of close to 60% between 1992 and 1996 - played a major role in this respect. This growth, together with the changing composition of exports, suggests that the structural  transformation  of  the  Hungarian  economy  has  gone  quite  far.  The  growth  of  net services exports points in the same direction.\n\n5. So much for the bright side of the picture, which is a good thing but should not be overstated.\n\nFirst,  these  are  improvements  in  comparison  with  the  unsustainable  imbalances which characterised both the situation prevailing in 1988-89 and that of the years 1993-94.\n\nSecond, the price paid by the majority of Hungarians was very heavy indeed: a drop in net real earnings of 12% in 1995, followed by another of 4% last year. Even if this was arguably unavoidable, given the size of the imbalances which had to be corrected (and which themselves had been caused, to some extent at least, by the premature rise in real earnings in 1994), the size of the sacrifices remains a fact. Against this background, any further erosion of average living standards would be just as unsustainable as were the macroeconomic imbalances in 1993-94.\n\nThird,  the  rate  of  inflation  is  still  far  too  high.  Admittedly,  since  the  postdevaluation  peak  reached  in  the  late  spring  of  1995  -  of  more  than  30%  -  the  rate  has  been declining steadily,  to  stand  by  December  last  year  at  a  shade  below  20%.  But  I  am  seriously worried by the fact that the Hungarian rate of inflation, while never moving towards three digits, has remained stuck within the 18-35% range over the past seven years. The worst was avoided by maintaining positive real interest rates during the greater part of this period, but the distorting effects of such inflation rates on the economy remain substantial, not to mention their socially unacceptable impact on those people whose earnings cannot be adjusted to inflation.\n\n6.  Looking  ahead,  I  hope  that  you  will  bear  with  me  if  I  become  a  little philosophical. All knowledgeable observers of Hungarian history, ancient as well as contemporary, agree that Hungarians possess the very rare ability to pull back at the last minute\n\nfrom the brink of disaster or at least to extricate themselves from a seemingly hopeless situation. They unfortunately also note that once the Hungarians have done so, they miss the opportunity offered  by  their  own  success  to  carry  out  policies  with  a  long-term  perspective  in  mind.  I  do hope that history will not repeat itself.\n\nAdmittedly, any further decline in the average living standard  would  be unacceptable. The standard of living should be allowed to begin to rise - but only to the extent that this does not upset the basic balance of the economy again. At the same time, the reduction in inflation must continue at a pace which puts the attainment of single-digit inflation in sight. You must break out - downwards - of the 18 to 35% range. And, last but not least, the country will have to begin to tackle earnestly the major structural problems related to the pension, health care, education and social security systems. These are daunting challenges. Two reminders may help  when  tackling  them.  The  first  is  that  Hungary  has  managed  major  breakthroughs  in  the recent past which were just as difficult as these future challenges: over the past five years, real privatisation accompanied by a fundamental shift in the structure of industry and services; and, more recently, the handling of a macroeconomic crisis situation. The second is that most of these challenges  are  akin  to  those  encountered  by  modern  Western  societies.  For  these  challenges Hungary is in good company.\n\n## THE MONETARY POLICY ENVIRONMENT\n\nTwo  recent  changes  have  occurred  regarding  the  institutional  environment  in which the National Bank of Hungary is operating. I welcome both of them.\n\n1.  The  possibility  of  the  direct  financing  of  the  budget  deficit  by  the  NBH  has been  eliminated.  This  is  in  conformity  with  the  provisions  of  the  Maastricht  Treaty,  and  is  a measure which has already been implemented by all fifteen member countries of the European Union and which the EMI closely monitors. To remind you, this provision of the Treaty applies to the member countries at this stage, prior to effectively entering EMU. It would seem to me impossible for Hungary to join the European Union without this change in the law governing the operations of the NBH, even if Hungary's participation in the euro area were to come at a later stage.\n\nBut  this  is  only  an  institutional  or  political  argument.  There  is  more  to  it. Maastricht  or  no  Maastricht,  eliminating  the  direct  monetary  financing  of  budget  deficits  is simply economic common sense. In the long run, inflation is a monetary phenomenon: it cannot happen without an (at least) accommodating expansion of the money supply. And we know from historical experience that more often than not the major source of any such inflationary increase in the money supply has been the direct financing of government by the central bank. Hungary has  not  been  an  exception  to  this  general  rule  -  rather  its  confirmation.  And  once  inflation  is established, interest rates go up. Except for very short periods, it is impossible to keep market interest rates below the rate of inflation: who would be ready to undertake financial savings the remuneration of which would imply a loss in real financial wealth? To try to keep interest rates low by monetary financing of the government is a self-defeating device. It may work for a few months,  but  would  end  up  producing  more  inflation  and  higher,  not  lower,  interest  rates certainly higher nominal interest rates, but very likely also higher real rates. The simple reason for  this  is  that  people  are  not  fools  -  at  least  not  for  a  long  time.  Monetary  financing  of  the government is therefore likely to combine two evils at the same time: inflation and high interest rates.\n\n2.  The  accumulated  and  potential  future  losses  of  the  NBH  on  account  of  its borrowings  in  foreign  currency  have  been  taken  over  by  the  government.  This  is  a  salutary cleaning-up operation which ought to have been carried out long ago. It has no consequences for the  'real'  economy.  These  borrowings  have  been  undertaken  in  the  past  on  government instruction and with government approval, with the NBH acting solely as an intermediary. The NBH's only shareholder is the Hungarian State; the real burden of the State's direct or indirect external borrowing has to be borne by the present or future taxpayers. This real burden was to some extent hidden by the 'seigniorage' profits of the NBH, which had two consequences: they hid  the  size  of  this  burden  from  public  view;  and  they  distorted  the  NBH's  accounts.  As  all experts know, the size of this double distortion was proportional to the rate of inflation, and was aggravated by the NBH's sterilisation policy of large capital inflows, without which, however, inflation would not have been brought down from 30 to 20% within the past eighteen months. Sterilisation was therefore a wise policy; the real culprit is the rate of inflation, which is much higher  in  Hungary  than  in  the  countries  whose  currencies  were  used  for  borrowing.  In  a sentence: this long overdue measure serves both public transparency and democratic accountability (of both the government and the NBH) - even if the general public, or politicians, may  be  excused  for  not  fully  understanding  the  intricate  interconnection  between  accounting procedures in a country with high inflation and the processes of the real economy. This is a good example of the generalised mess created by inflation.\n\n## CHALLENGES FOR THE HUNGARIAN BANKS\n\nAs I said right at  the  outset,  it  is  now  time  to  look  ahead  and  begin  to  address some major issues for the Hungarian banks - issues which, thanks to the progress made over the past  few  years,  are  no  longer  totally  dissimilar  from  those  facing  banks  in  western  Europe.  I intend to make a few comments on these, since they are issues on which I can possibly throw some light on the basis of my own professional experience.\n\n1.  The  first  is  about  the  specificity  of  banking,  i.e.  about  the  possibility  or desirability of clearly distinguishing banks, through rules and regulations, from other financial intermediaries.  I  noted  that  the  recent  changes  in  Hungarian  banking  law  have  implied  a movement towards the de-specialisation of banks, notably in the field of securities transactions. I believe  that  a  development  towards  the  universal  banking  model  is  justified  -  on  certain conditions. It is justified for two groups of reasons.\n\nFirst, because financial innovation in general, and securitisation in particular, are breaking down the traditionally neat distinction between banks and other financial intermediaries, indeed even between financial intermediation and financial markets, all over the world. Some time ago, banks were defined as financial intermediaries whose liabilities (mainly sight and short-term deposits) were equivalent to the money supply, and the money supply was defined as the total  sum  of  bank  liabilities.  This  nice  circular  definition  kept  academics,  bank regulators and central bankers equally happy until the moment when financial innovation started blurring  the  distinction  between  money  and  other  financial  assets,  and  securitisation  began blurring  the  distinction  between  financial  intermediation  and  financial  market  operations.  The proliferation  of  derivatives,  financial  futures  and  the  like  added  to  the  confusion  between balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. The result is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to identify banking on the basis of the old equivalence of 'banking liabilities = money supply'. This has now been recognised in the sweeping deregulation of banking activities affecting the whole of western Europe and, though more cautiously, also the United States. In some cases this has gone so far as to allow the emergence of consolidated banking and insurance activities.\n\nSecond, in a shorter Hungarian perspective, banks in Hungary have a head start on  other  financial  intermediaries  in  collecting  the  financial  savings  of  households  and  of  the enterprise  sector.  Admittedly,  Hungary  badly  needs the large-scale development  of  life assurance  companies,  pension  funds,  mutual  funds  and  the  like,  i.e.  all  those  institutional investors  which  can  channel  savings  towards  equity  investment.  But  this  takes  time,  since experience and human resources are rare  and  the  reform  of  the  pension  system  and  of  health services takes time. Banks should be allowed to fill the gap for the time being, by putting at the disposal of savers a wide variety of financial instruments.\n\n2.  Now  let  me  come  to  the  risks  that  a  generalised  move  towards  universal banking could entail, and the ways and means of containing them.\n\nThe  main  risk,  of  course,  is  the  emergence  of  conflicts  of  interest.  One  such potential  conflict  of  interest  may  arise  within  any  bank,  between  the  bank's  own  risk-taking activity and risk-taking for its customers. The classic example of this is the potential conflict of interest between credit-granting and securities underwriting, but this is only one example. The traditional  way  of  avoiding  the  misuse  of  such  conflict-creating  situations  is  (a)  to  devise  an organisational structure with clearly distinguishable lines of responsibility, (b) to avoid flows of 'inside' information between the various activities, (c) to attribute to each activity costs, income and profits, and (d) to entrust external auditors with the surveillance of the systems put in place. The end-result will, of course, never be entirely safe. Moreover, the building of 'Chinese walls' inside  a  multi-polar  banking  organisation  may  weaken,  or  even  destroy,  the  synergy  between those poles, i.e. it may undermine the rationale of a multi-polar organisation. I would not want, however,  to  overstate  the  internal  conflict  of  interest  argument.  In  the  long  run,  the  kind  of conflict to which I have referred is unlikely to be very strong. In a longer-term perspective, no bank can afford to favour its own risk-taking activity at the expense of its customers - especially if auditing makes it certain that any misuse of the bank's powers would come to light.\n\n3. Another much more dangerous conflict of interest could arise where the bank is capable of exercising a decisive shareholding power in another non-banking firm, of which it is at the same time a major creditor. This could have unacceptable consequences not only for the firm's other shareholders but, if the practice became widespread, could even lead to structural distortions for entire industries. To avoid this happening, I would favour rather strict regulations. For  instance,  mutual  funds  managed  by  banks  should  either  have  limits  on  the  equity participation in individual firms or not have access to the firm's Board. The same should apply, a fortiori, to any bank's direct and permanent equity participation in a non-banking firm - unless, perhaps, the bank remains just a shareholder (as if it were, say, a pension fund), without direct banking operations with the firm in question.\n\n4.  Under  the  last  point,  I  already  touched  on  one  particular  aspect  of  corporate governance, namely when a bank can play a decisive role in a non-banking firm's life. But you will also have to face up to the reverse problem: when a non-banking firm becomes a bank's key shareholder and could therefore potentially induce risk-taking by the bank in its favour, at the expense of the bank's other shareholders or of its depositors or customers. This is a particularly acute danger in countries where there are not many non-bank institutional shareholders, where the  defence  of  minority  shareholders  has  no  tradition  and  where  depositors  are  not  properly protected. Such problems have been encountered in Western market economies. It is clearly in Hungary's interest to build up, or consolidate, the appropriate defences against the emergence of such problems.\n\n5.  In  order  to  avoid  any  misunderstandings,  I  am  not  launching  any  appeal  in favour of overregulation. In a market economy, the best regulator is the market itself. And when spontaneous  market  regulation  fails  -  which  does  happen  -  the  second-best  solution  is  to  use regulatory  techniques  which  favour  the  emergence  of  market-led  self-regulation.  I  am  simply trying  to  make  two  points.  First,  that  banking  and  finance  have  broader  and  more  general implications for the economy as a whole than any other kind of activity. A crisis in, say, the steel industry creates hardship, but it does not create a general crisis. A banking crisis may well do so. Second, banking and finance are evolving at a very fast pace under the combined influence of technological  progress,  innovation  and  globalisation.  This  needs  a  careful  adjustment  of  the regulatory framework, not its general weakening.\n\n6. In a very different area, may I call your attention to the need to develop both retail banking in the narrow sense of the term and also banking services to the dynamic sector of small and medium-sized enterprises. In these fields, Hungarian banking is vastly underdeveloped,  both  in  the  number  of  consumer-friendly  local  offices  and,  even  more importantly,  in  the  range  of  high-quality  banking  services  offered  to  these  two  groups  of customers.  This  underdevelopment  is  particularly  striking  when  it  is  compared  with  the sophistication of some of the wholesale banking activities being offered.\n\nThis  is  most  regrettable  and  goes  against  the  long-term  interests  of  the  banks themselves,  not  to  mention  those  of  the  country.  Households  are,  and  will  remain,  the  major source of the country's financial savings. They deserve to be supplied with appropriate, safe and diversified vehicles which allow them to find an outlet for their financial wealth. Some small and  medium-sized  firms  are  net  savers;  others  desperately  need  financing  for  development purposes, which financial markets will not be able to provide for a very long time indeed. I have known of a number of western European and even North American banks which derived great strength from their solid retail  banking  basis,  which  helped  them  considerably  in  situations  in which some, if not many, of their cherished wholesale customers went bust.\n\nYou will also need the retail banking basis for another reason. Satisfied household and small enterprise customers provide you with the greatest public support. And I can assure you  that  you  will  need  this  support  in  a  democratic  society.  Banking  has  never  been,  and  is unlikely  to  become,  a  popular  activity,  especially  when  it  relies  exclusively  on  customers recruited from among large corporations and very wealthy individuals. Beware of the danger of political backlash.\n\nIn  developing your retail  activities,  you  will  have  to  monitor  western  European experiences carefully. Many western European countries are overbanked in this field, and a good deal  of  discussion  is  focusing  on  the  merits  of  customer  proximity  versus  home-computer banking.  My  feeling  is  that  you  will  be  able  to  avoid  some  of  the  earlier  western  European excesses,  and  rely  directly  on  the  most  recent  communications  and  information  systems technology.  But  for  a  long  time  to  come,  most  of  your  customers  will  need  close,  human proximity. The comparative assessment of the costs and benefits of these two approaches will be a very great challenge for the Hungarian banking system.\n\nI hope that in ten years' time, if I am still around, I shall be able to congratulate you on having been able to successfully meet this challenge. Meanwhile, I wish you good luck and the ability to help the emergence of good luck by hard work, skilful management and good strategic choices.",

         "Remarks by the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Mr. William J. McDonough, at the Society of Investment Analysts in Dublin on 11/2/97.",
         "Mr. McDonough assesses the role of  the  central  bank  in  ensuring  a  stable price  and  financial  environment  and  fostering  sustainable  growth Remarks  by  the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Mr. William J. McDonough, at the Society of Investment Analysts in Dublin on 11/2/97.\n\nI  am  delighted  to  have  the  opportunity  to  address  the  Society  of  Investment Analysts here in Ireland, home of my forebears. In my remarks this evening, I want to say a few words  on  a  topic  of  great  importance  to  both  our  professions:  the  role  of  central  banks  in ensuring a stable price and financial environment, and fostering sustainable growth. I would also like to offer some thoughts on the importance of a safe and sound banking system for the wellbeing of the economy.\n\nAs members of the financial community, we all recognize the importance of price stability to the successful long-run performance of the economy. Indeed, there now seems to be a worldwide convergence of views among central bankers and investors alike on the importance of price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy. For me personally, stable prices have always been the prism for making monetary policy decisions.\n\nAs I see it,  price  stability  must  be  viewed  in  a  long-run  context  as  an  ongoing goal,  not  a  one-time  objective.  That  goal  requires  monetary  policy  to  be  oriented  beyond  the horizon  of  its  immediate  or  near-term  impact  on  inflation  and  the  economy.  The  primary purpose of near-term policy actions should  be  to  set  the  economy  on  a  long-term,  permanent path to price stability and sound economic growth.\n\nThis orientation puts the focus of policy on inflation expectations over the long term -- the time horizon that is appropriate for most saving and investment decisions. Businesses and households are understandably concerned about the long-term consequences of inflation and price level uncertainty. This is the frame of reference reflected in the conceptual definition of price  stability  offered  by  the  chairman  of  the  Federal  Reserve,  Alan  Greenspan  --  that  price stability  is  achieved  when  people  do  not  consider  inflation  a  factor  in  their  business  and economic decisions.\n\nLong-term inflation expectations must be anchored to a transparent and rigorous commitment by the central bank to a well-defined standard of price stability, and unavoidable deviations from the goal of price stability must be explained with reference to that standard.\n\nIn my view, price stability is a means to an end -- the promotion of sustainable economic growth. Only with long-term  price  stability  can  the  economy  expect  to  achieve  the maximum levels of productivity and living standards.\n\nPrice stability is both important and desirable because a rising price level, even at moderate  rates,  imposes  substantial  economic  costs  on  society.  These  costs  emanate  from  a variety of sources, including:\n\n- -increased uncertainty about the outcome  of  business decisions  and profitability;\n- -adverse  effects  on  the  cost  of  capital  resulting  from  the  interaction  of inflation with the tax system;\n- -reduced effectiveness of the price and market systems; and\n- -distortions  that  create  perverse  incentives  to  engage  in  nonproductive activities.\n\nAs a former commercial banker, I am especially aware of the negative effects of one particular type of nonproductive activity induced by inflation's distortion of incentives -- the overinvestment  of  resources  in  the  financial  sector.  It  is  well  known  that,  in  high-inflation economies,  the resources diverted from productive activities to nonproductive financial transactions are enormous. But even moderate inflation rates can cause substantial diversion to nonproductive  financial  activities,  and  this  diversion  deserves  greater  attention  than  it  often receives in economists' list of the costs of inflation.\n\nAs I look back over the last ten years or so, I am pleased that the Federal Reserve and  many  other  central  banks  have  been  successful  in  controlling  price  pressures  and  putting inflation on a long-run downward track. Success in dealing with inflation clearly enhances the credibility of monetary policy and policy makers.\n\nFrom  my  perspective,  the  continuing  challenge  for  central  banks  is  to  ensure long-term  credibility  for  monetary  policy  by  sustaining  low  inflation  environments.  Central banks are generally better able to meet this challenge if they are substantially immunized from short-term political pressures, and are firmly committed to price stability as the overriding goal of monetary policy.\n\nEmpirical  research  in  recent  years  has  shown  that  both  the  average  rate  of inflation  and  its  variability  tend  to  decline  in  tandem  with  increased  independence  for  central banks.  This  is  why  so  many  governments,  including  those  among  the  emerging  market economies, have been providing their central banks with increased autonomy. Of course, it  is possible to have low inflation or price stability even with a limited degree of legal central bank independence, but the record clearly shows that a country is more likely to have low inflation if its  central  bank  is  independent.  One  important  reason  for  this  is  that  the  fiscal  authorities  in many countries have not proven to be highly disciplined.\n\nOf course, some would argue that focusing on price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy means that central banks would no longer be concerned about output or job growth. I believe this view simply is wrong. A stable price and financial  environment  almost certainly enhances the capacity of monetary policy to fight occasions of cyclical weakness in the economy.\n\nA  central  bank's  commitment  to  price  stability  over  the  longer  term  does  not mean that monetary policy can ignore the short-term impact of economic events. It is important to  recognize  that,  even  when  an  economy  is  set  on  the  path  to  price  stability,  and  price expectations are contained, it does not necessarily mean that all potential sources of inflationary shocks have been eliminated.\n\nMoreover, while there is no long-run trade-off between unemployment, or output, and inflation, both formal evidence and common sense observation on wage and price rigidities attest to the existence of such a trade-off in the short run. In the long run, however, monetary policy's  impact  is  only  on  inflation;  potential  output  primarily  is  determined  by  advances  in technology, growth in human and physical capital and other real resources.\n\nBecause  of  the  uncertainty  about  the  timing  and  significance  of  short-term monetary policy effects on economic activity, as well as all other uncertainties concerning the economy, there  are  always  differences  of  view  about  the  speed  with  which  policy  should  be adjusted,  and  on  the  balance  of  risks  in  dealing  with  ongoing  economic  developments.  These conflicts become more marked when an economy confronts supply shocks that drive up prices\n\nsharply and suddenly -- such as the two oil shocks of the 1970s. In those circumstances, from my perspective, the appropriate course, consistent with maintaining longer term price stability, should be to bring inflation down somewhat gradually, as the economy adjusts to the  shift  in relative prices.\n\nAs  I  see  it,  monetary  policy  must  be  formulated  cautiously,  and  cannot  ignore business  cycle  developments.  In  establishing  price  stability  as  the  primary  goal  of  monetary policy, therefore, it is best to recognize that monetary policy does affect output in the short run. A  central  bank  can  appropriately  be  assigned  the  task  of  promoting  sustainable  economic growth,  while  maintaining  long-term  price  stability  and  ensuring  the  health  of  the  financial system. This way of articulating policy goals has the advantage of meeting the public's need to understand  the  basis  for  monetary  policy  decisions,  and  may  help,  therefore,  to  enhance  the democratic accountability of monetary policy.\n\nOnce monetary policy is firmly committed  to  price  stability,  how  can  a  central bank best reach that goal? Clearly, at an operational level, no single formula or implementation strategy  can  be  expected  to  succeed  in  all  countries  and  under  all  circumstances;  possible approaches can take many different forms. The choices depend on a country's history, economic conditions,  traditions  and  institutions.  But  all  successful  approaches  share  two  important features:  first,  they  focus  on  a  long-term  time  horizon  and,  second,  they  provide  a  clear  and public standard for the assessment of policy.\n\nWhat is most significant is not the specific way a central bank  chooses  to  seek price stability, but rather the underlying commitment to that goal.\n\nWhile  monetary  policy  aimed  at  long-run  price  stability  is  critical  to  fostering sustainable  economic growth, central banks' role in promoting growth  and,  more  generally,  a healthy  economy  goes  beyond  the  conduct  of  monetary  policy.  Through  involvement  in financial regulation and supervision, as well as in the oversight of payments system operations, central  banks  play  a  key  role  in  preserving  and  enhancing  the  safety  and  soundness  of  the banking and financial system.\n\nAll  of  these  central  bank  functions  are  mutually  dependent  and,  together, highlight  the  fact  that  the  structure  and  workings  of  the  banking  system  are  integral  to  a country's financial stability and economic growth. Clearly, monetary policy cannot succeed in its mission if the underlying financial system is unstable.\n\nThe importance of an efficient, safe and sound banking and financial system for a country's  long-term  economic  prospects  cannot  be  overstated.  In  any  market  economy,  the banking  and  financial  system  plays  a  central  role  in  mobilizing  a  society's  savings  and  in channeling these savings into investment and other productive uses. This intermediation process is one of the core determinants of the pace of a country's economic development. Moreover, the banking and financial system must facilitate transactions in an economy by ensuring that they can be effected safely and swiftly on an ongoing basis. Both buyers and sellers of  goods  and services  must  have  confidence  that  instruments  used  to  make  payments  will  be  honored  and accepted by all parties.\n\nThese crucial functions of transforming savings into productive uses and making payments are often taken for granted. But, in fact, it can be difficult to ensure that the legal and institutional framework within which these functions are performed is consistent with the often conflicting  goals  of  free  choice,  economic  efficiency,  safety  and  financial  market  stability.\n\nExperience has proven that there is no easy way to shape financial institutions in a manner that appropriately balances these goals under changing economic conditions.\n\nToday,  numerous  countries  --  including  Ireland  and  the  United  States  --  are considering which paths to follow in reforming and modernizing their banking industries. These deliberations  are  of  great  importance,  because  a  well-functioning  and  stable  banking  and financial system is a critical foundation for long-run growth and prosperity of an economy. And such  reform  is  inevitably  difficult,  for  reasons  which  are  a  classic  blend  of  political  and economic considerations rooted in the crucial functions the banking system must perform in a market economy.\n\nMoreover, banking system reform is made all the  more  challenging  by  the  fact that such reforms cannot be viewed in isolation from reforms in the central bank, or independent of those in the capital markets. In fact, the greatest challenge may lie in forging these individual pieces in such a way that they fit together in a cohesive whole that serves the dictates of stability, growth, and public confidence.\n\nFor a financial system to  mobilize  and  allocate  a  society's  savings  successfully and  facilitate  day-to-day  transactions,  there  must  be  a  class  of  financial  institutions  and instruments that the public views as safe and convenient outlets for its savings. Of course, the single dominant class of institution that performs this crucial dual role as repository of a large part  of  society's  liquid  savings,  and  the  entity  through  which  payments  are  made  is  the commercial  bank.  This  is  true  even  in  countries  with  highly  developed  capital  markets, especially  when it  is  kept  in  mind  that  participants  in  the  capital  markets  rely  heavily  on  the banking system for their financing facilities.\n\nBanks cannot play an effective role in the financial intermediation process unless the public has the utmost confidence in the banking system. This confidence is a key reason why banking  institutions  and  banking  instruments  are  crucial  to  a  country's  economic  growth  and development. The combination of functions typically provided by commercial banks, however, also carries with it the risk that a loss of confidence in an individual institution can spread to the system as a whole, the so-called systemic risk phenomenon.\n\nInstances  in  which  a  country  experiences  a  loss  of  confidence  in  its  financial institutions  usually  result  in  major  damage  to  the  economy.  Given  the  indispensable  role  that financial  institutions  play  in  the  success  of  a  country's  economy,  governments  clearly  have  a responsibility to subject financial institutions to some form of regulation or oversight.\n\nBut  here  again,  there  is  need  for  balance.  Restrictions  placed  on  banks  by  the financial  oversight  apparatus  cannot  be  allowed  to  discourage  risk-taking  per  se,  because risk-taking  is  an  inherent  part  of  banking  and  finance  in  market  economies.  To  perform successfully, a commercial banking system requires a delicate balance between risk-taking and maintaining  public  confidence.  Because  of  the  importance  and  the  difficulties  inherent  in  the balancing act, banking systems are generally subject to a higher degree of official oversight and regulation  than  are  most  other  forms  of  private  enterprise,  and  supported  by  some  form  of  a broad safety net.\n\nWhile the specifics can differ appreciably across countries, these safety nets are usually  constructed  along  similar  lines.  They  generally  include  oversight  of  the  affairs  of banking institutions in the form of inspection and examination of the institutions for compliance with a broad set of safety and soundness standards; some type of protection against losses for\n\nsmall  depositors  and  investors;  and  some  form  of  emergency  liquidity  facility  for  banking institutions  and,  occasionally,  for  other  financial  institutions  as  well.  Finally,  the  payments system,  a  crucial  link  in  any  financial  system,  generally  includes  some  form  of  official regulation of or participation in its operations.\n\nThese  important  aspects  of  the  safety  net  often  feed  into  one  or  more  of  the functions performed by central banks. For this reason, the central  bank  usually  plays  a  major role in the operation of one or more of these facets of the safety net. For example, the emergency liquidity facility is almost always the discount window of the central bank. In many countries -including Ireland and the United States -- the central bank also plays an important role in the supervision of banking institutions and in the oversight of payments system operations.\n\nThe important role played by the central bank in helping to build and maintain confidence in the underlying stability of the financial system in turn implies that there must be a high  degree  of  public  confidence  in  the  central  bank  itself.  This  brings  me  back  full  circle: achieving and maintaining that public confidence depends first and foremost on the success of the central bank in discharging its monetary policy responsibilities. A sound economy and sound money are virtually synonymous, which is why monetary policy stands at the center of central bank functions.\n\nThe  importance  of  monetary  policy  is  also  the  reason  why  central  banks  need special  independent  status  within  the  governments  they  serve.  In  my  view,  it  is  particularly critical  that  the  central  bank  not  be  directly  responsible  for  financing  government  budget deficits; such a responsibility can, over time, compromise the financial integrity of the central bank, and thereby, public confidence in it. Note, however, that even without any involvement in direct  financing  of  government  budget  deficits,  central  banks  have  a  major  stake  in  the development and maintenance of a smoothly-functioning government securities market, which can  provide  substantial  benefits  to  the  economy  beyond  those  emanating  from  private  sector financing of government budget deficits.\n\nIn closing, I want to stress that the commitment to price stability as the primary goal  of  monetary  policy  in  no  way  implies  that  the  health  of  the  economy  or  of  the  financial system  should  be  sacrificed.  On  the  contrary,  what  is  important  to  bear  in  mind  is  that  by ensuring  a  stable  price  and  financial  environment,  the  central  bank  helps  foster  economic growth.\n\nI  believe  that  no  central  bank  can  maintain  price  stability  over  the  longer  term without public support for the necessary policies. Only with the confidence of the public in their policies and their own lasting dedication to non-inflationary growth together with a well-functioning financial system can central banks succeed in achieving and maintaining price and financial stability.",

         "Mr. Macfarlane discusses the economics of nostalgia Talk by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr. I.J. Macfarlane, to The Sydney Institute on 11/2/97.\n\n## 1.  Introduction\n\nIt is a  great pleasure to be speaking at The Sydney Institute, which has done so much  over  recent  years  to  keep  alive  informed  discussion  of  public  affairs  and  the  arts.  In keeping with this tradition, I have chosen to speak on a subject with a historical, economic and political  theme.  I  would  like  to  look  back  at  the  1950s  and  1960s,  and  evaluate  some  of  the lessons that people take from this period. The further my professional life proceeds, the more value I see in a good knowledge of economic history, even if it is so recent that most of us have lived and worked through it. As you will gather, my views on history are much closer to George Santayana's than to Henry Ford's.\n\nThere can be no quibble with the proposition that macro-economic performance in the immediate post-war period, which for present purposes I will refer to as the 1950s and 1960s, was far superior to any period before or after. This has led a lot of people to use it as a basis for proposing economic policies for today. They look back at how things were done in the 1950s  and  1960s,  and  say  'if  only  we  did  it  the  same  way  today,  our  macro-economic performance would be as good as it was then'. This approach has some merit but, if we are to use it, it is very important that we get our facts straight about what the policies actually were in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThere are two propositions of policy relevance that are frequently made about this period.  The  first  one  is  that  the  macro-economic  success  at  that  time  was  due  to  the  use  of activist and expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. The second is that the world economy was moving along very smoothly in the post-war period, with everything under control, until hit by the external shock of the  OPEC-induced  oil  price  rise  in  late  1973  (and  again  in  1979).  I would like to analyse these two propositions with particular reference to Australia, but in doing so  it  will  be  necessary  to  bring  in  a  lot  of  international  economic  and  political  events, particularly those occurring in the United States.\n\n## 2.  Macro-economic  performance  in  the  1950s  and  1960s\n\nIt is not necessary to spend much time demonstrating how successful this period was in terms of macro-economic performance because no-one disputes it. Table 1 shows that the real growth rate for the world economy was more than twice as high in the 1950-1973 period than in the previous 80 years. In Australia there was also a major improvement, although less than a doubling. Inflation, which had been negligible on average until the Second World War, rose  to  about  4  per  cent  in  the  1950-1973  period,  with  the  average  being  pushed  up  by  the Korean War period and the early 1970s. At other times it was a good deal lower, and even with these periods included, it was moderate enough to permit economic expansion for most of the period. Unemployment remained low throughout the period, although there was some cyclical movement at times. Overall, macro-economic performance was considerably better in this period than  in  any  time  before  or  since,  which  has  prompted  economic  historians  such  as  Maddison (1991) to refer to this period as the 'Golden Age'.\n\nBIS Review   20/1997\n\nTable  1: Indicators  of  World (a)   and  Australian (b)  Macro-economic  Performance\n\n(average  annual  increase)\n\n|           | GDP       | CPI           |\n|-----------|-----------|---------------|\n| 1870-1950 | 2.3 (2.9) | 0.1 (c) (1.3) |\n| 1950-1973 | 4.9 (4.7) | 4.1 (4.6)     |\n| 1973-1980 | 2.6 (3.1) | 7.3 (9.7)     |\n\n(a)  Sixteen largest OECD countries; (b)  Australian figures in brackets; (c)  Peacetime years. Source: Maddison (1991).\n\nThere  were  a  number  of  factors  behind  this  impressive  economic  performance,  but  time  and space limit  me  to  mentioning  only  the  main  ones.  The  four  most  important,  I  believe,  are  as follows:\n\n(i) There was a big gap to be made up following the Depression and the Second World War. The 1950s and 1960s was a period of post-war reconstruction or 'catch-up' for most countries. The largest growth pick-up occurred in the countries most devastated by the war, such as Germany, Italy, Japan and Austria, and the least pronounced (although still significant) were in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Sweden and Australia.\n\n(ii) Although populations and  governments  were  eager  for  economic growth, there was widespread restraint in economic behaviour. The privations endured during the Depression and the War meant that as incomes rose, a high proportion was saved. Inflationary expectations too had been conditioned by decades of nearly zero inflation, which showed up in modest pricing and wage setting behaviour for much of the  period.  Some  commentators  also  stress  the  political  cohesion  among  western countries as a result of the ever-present influence of the Cold War.\n\n(iii) International  trade  was  liberalised  and  exports  and  imports  grew rapidly. This was a sharp contrast with the inter-war period. Maddison says 'perhaps the least controversial assertion one can make about the Golden Age is that it involved a  remarkable  revival  of  liberalism  in  international  transactions.  Trade  and  payment barriers  erected  in  the  1930s  and  during  the  War  were  removed.  The  new-style liberalism was buttressed by effective arrangements for regular consultation between Western Countries and for mutual financial assistance' (IMF, OECD and GATT (now WTO).)\n\n(iv) Governments  conducted  good  macro-economic  policies  with  a greater  emphasis  on  economic  growth  than  in  previous  decades.  In  a  number  of countries the  new-found commitment  to growth and  low  unemployment  was enshrined in legislation. In others it was less formal, but in nearly every country the first  decades  after  the  Second  World  War  were  characterised  by  well-balanced  and successful macro-economic policies. A more detailed examination of these macro-economic policies, particularly in Australia, is the subject of my next section.\n\n## 3.  The  role  of  macro-economic  policies\n\nThere  is  no  doubt  that  the  dominant  principle  behind  macro-economic  policy changed after the Second World War in line with Keynesian teaching, but the change occurred more quickly in some countries than others.\n\nThe  main  change  was  that  fiscal  policy  was  to  be  used  actively  to  promote economic growth by deliberately incurring budget deficits at times of weak economic activity. Fiscal policy and monetary policy together were termed demand management policy, and they were  to  be  adjusted  to  smooth  the  business  cycle,  to  increase  growth  and  to  achieve  full employment. In Australia's case, this approach was enshrined in a document - the 1945 White Paper, 'Full Employment in Australia'.\n\nThis approach to policy was very successful in that it achieved its aims of high growth rates and low unemployment for several decades, and it did so with generally low rates of inflation. The achievement was all the greater, given that the 1950s contained a major shock in the form of the Korean War commodity price boom. This high level of success has led many people to assume that policy must have been operated with a high degree of activism, i.e. by choosing very expansionary settings of policy. But this was not the case. For most of the period we  are  considering,  demand  management  policy  was  quite  restrained  and,  where  necessary, restrictive. Certainly its guiding principle was Keynesian, but it was operated in a very balanced way and was, in any case, subject to an important constraint, which I will come to later.\n\nThat  this  was  the  case  should  not  be  a  surprise  to  people  who  remember  the period. For example, the Fadden 'Horror Budget' of 1951/52 and the 'Credit Squeeze' of 1961, which  nearly  cost  the  Menzies  Government  office,  have  gone  into  folklore.  Of  course,  there were  also  periods  where  policy  was  expansionary,  but  on  average  the  result  was  relatively balanced. While growth was high, on average, there was also a business cycle operating during this period, with a couple of reasonably clearly defined recessions and booms.\n\nThe fact that policy was well balanced can be shown for fiscal policy by a couple of graphs.  Unfortunately, comparable data do not go back earlier than 1961/62, so we will have to  lose  the  1950s  from  our  comparisons.  Diagram  1  shows  the  best  general  measure  of  the underlying budget deficit. In the 12 years from 1961/62 to 1973/74 the budget was, on average,\n\nDiagram 1 Budget Balance* Per cent of GDP\n\n* General government on an underlying basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin surplus to the extent of ½ per cent of GDP, and the fluctuations around the average were not very large. In the period since then, the budget has nearly always been in deficit, with an average deficit  of  nearly  2  per  cent  of  GDP.  You  can  see  the  three  attempts  made  to  bring  it  back towards  surplus  -  the  first  one  when  Mr. Howard  was  Treasurer,  the  second  one  under  Mr. Keating as Treasurer, and the third one which is being continued at the moment by Mr. Costello. In summary, it is the more recent period that could be characterised as activist and expansionary in  that  there  are  bigger  swings  in  the  budgetary  position  and,  on  average,  it  tends  to  show  a much bigger deficit.\n\nDiagram 2\n\n## General Government Outlays\n\nPer cent of GDP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnother measure of fiscal activism is the size of government expenditure relative to the economy. It will come as no surprise to see that general government outlays relative to GDP were much lower in the 1960s than they are now (Diagram 2); in the earlier period they accounted for about 25 per cent of GDP, but over the last two decades they have averaged 34 per cent of GDP.\n\nThe stance of monetary policy is more difficult to analyse because interest rates cannot  be  used  as  the  measure  of  comparison.  This  is  because  before  the  early  1980s  the financial system was heavily regulated, with the Government imposing interest rate ceilings on most forms of lending. Tightenings and easings in monetary policy showed up largely through credit rationing - the ease or difficulty in obtaining a loan at a given interest rate. This would be familiar to people who can remember the difficulty of obtaining a housing mortgage at that time. The best way of judging whether monetary policy was tight or loose in such a system was to see how fast it allowed money and credit to grow.  The growth of the money supply is shown in Diagram 3, and again we see relatively low and stable expansion during the 1950s and 1960s (except for the Korean War boom), before the turmoil starts in the 1970s (in this case, the very early 1970s).\n\nI referred earlier to the fact that monetary and fiscal policy had to operate under an important constraint during the 1950s and 1960s. The constraint to which I am referring is the gold exchange standard, whereby virtually all OECD countries fixed their exchange rate to the US dollar, which in turn fixed to gold. In Australia's case, our exchange rate to the US dollar did not change between 1949 and 1971. This was in a way the centrepiece of our economic policy.\n\nMonetary policy and fiscal policy could not get too expansionary without either inflation or the balance of payments threatening the exchange rate. This mechanism effectively meant that our macro-economic policies (and those of most OECD economies) could not get too far out of line with the policies pursued by the US Government. A recognition of this link means that if we wish to fully understand what happened in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, we have to look more closely at the trends in US economic policy. This also means that we  will  have  to  stop looking at  the  1950s,  1960s  and  early  1970s  as  a  whole,  and  instead  divide  it  into  two  quite different sub-periods.\n\nDiagram 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n* M3\n\n## 4.  The  end  of  the  Golden  Age\n\nThe  role  of  the  United  States  is  crucial  here.  Despite  its  having  enacted  the Employment Act of 1946, the United States continued to run reasonably conservative demand management policies through the Truman and Eisenhower years and even in the early part of the Kennedy Presidency. In this period US economic policy came in for a fair bit of criticism from economists, particularly outside the United States, for being too cautious. There was some basis to  this  criticism  in  that  US  policy  makers  did  seem  to  be  less  keen  to  expand  than  their counterparts in other countries, particularly in Europe.\n\nAmerican  attitudes  changed  in  the  early  1960s,  but  nothing  concrete  occurred until the Johnson years. The turning point was the tax cuts introduced in 1964 and 1965 which were described by one of their architects - Arthur Okun - as 'The largest stimulative fiscal action ever undertaken by the federal government in peacetime ... the first major stimulative measure adopted  in  the  post-war  era  at  a  time  when  the  economy  was  neither  in,  nor  threatened imminently  by,  recession.  And,  unlike  earlier  tax  reductions,  they  were  taken  in  a  budgetary situation marked by the twin facts that the federal budget was in deficit and federal expenditures were rising.' This certainly got the United States moving and was soon followed by increased defence  expenditure  occasioned  by  the  Vietnam  War,  and  other  government  expenditure associated with the Great Society programs. Some of the proponents of the original tax cuts then argued for tax increases but, not surprisingly, they found these were harder to put into place than were the earlier tax cuts.\n\nIn  the  second  half  of  the  1960s  and  early  1970s  the  US  economy  grew  very quickly and inflation began to rise. For a time it was held in check by the Fed's willingness to run  a  tight  monetary  policy,  but  with  the  appointment  of  Arthur  Burns  as  Fed  Chairman, monetary  policy  became  more  accommodating.  President  Nixon  found  that  expansionary policies  were  popular,  and  continued  in  the  same  vein  as  his  predecessor.  By  1971,  with  the United States running a large current account deficit, it could no longer hold its commitment to gold and the US dollar was effectively devalued against gold and against other major currencies.\n\nTable  2:\n\n## Unemployment  Rates  in  G10  Countries  and  Australia\n\n|                  |   1965* |   1973* |\n|------------------|---------|---------|\n| USA              |     4.5 |     4.9 |\n| Japan            |     1.3 |     1.4 |\n| Germany          |     0.7 |     1.2 |\n| France           |     1.3 |     2.7 |\n| Italy            |     5.4 |     6.7 |\n| UK               |     1.4 |     2.1 |\n| Canada           |     3.9 |     5.6 |\n| Sweden           |     1.2 |     2.5 |\n| Belgium          |     2.5 |     3.7 |\n| Netherlands      |     1   |     3.9 |\n| Average of above |     2.1 |     3.1 |\n| Australia        |     1.6 |     2.3 |\n\n* For 1965, figures are the average for the year; for 1973, they are the average for the first three quarters (i.e. pre-OPEC I).\n\nTable  3: Inflation  Rates  in  G10  Countries  and  Australia\n\n|                  |   1965 |   1973 |\n|------------------|--------|--------|\n| USA              |    1.7 |    6.9 |\n| Japan            |    5.9 |   12.6 |\n| Germany          |    3.8 |    6.9 |\n| France           |    2.3 |    7.4 |\n| Italy            |    3.3 |   11.8 |\n| UK               |    4.4 |    9.2 |\n| Canada           |    2.8 |    8.2 |\n| Sweden           |    6.7 |    9.1 |\n| Belgium          |    4   |    8.8 |\n| Netherlands      |    6.8 |    8.4 |\n| Average of above |    3.2 |    8.4 |\n| Australia        |    4.1 |   10.4 |\n\nYear to December 1965 and to September 1973 (i.e. pre-OPEC I).\n\nThere was  now  no  longer  an  anchor  to  the  international  financial  system.  Thus,  the  post-war period should really be divided into two sub-periods, with the US tax cuts of 1965 marking a convenient dividing line. Thereafter, US policy became expansionary, and it ceased to provide a constraint on the actions of other countries.\n\nIt is instructive to see what happened in a range of countries during this second period, that is between the turning point in US policy in 1965 and the OPEC shock at the end of 1973.  The  story  is  very  similar  for  all  OECD  countries.  Their  economies  continued  to  grow strongly,  but  they  were  not  able  to  get  their  unemployment  any  lower  than  the  already  low starting point (see Table 2).The main effect of these expansionary policies was to push inflation to  levels  that  were  not  consistent  with  sustainable  economic  growth.  As  a  general  rule,  most countries' unemployment rates rose slightly, but their inflation rates doubled (see Table 3). By 1972 and 1973 the world economy was in an inflationary boom. How did Australia fare in this period?\n\nOur  story  was  very  similar  to  the  general  pattern,  although  the  deterioration  in inflation  was  more  marked  here.  Our  inflation  rate,  which  had  been  about  4  per  cent  in  the mid-1960s, reached 10.4 per cent in the year to the September quarter of 1973. That means that we had already got our inflation rate into double digits before OPEC came along to deliver a further inflationary  impulse  (see  Diagram  4).  Our  problems  were  compounded  by  the inflationary boom that the world found itself in 1972 and 1973. Commodity prices were rising rapidly, as were our export receipts. With the monetary policy instruments then available, and with  the  fixed  exchange  rate,  it  was  not  possible  to  quarantine  the  monetary  effects,  and  the money supply was soon growing at more than 20 per cent per annum. We did not help ourselves very  much  either  with  the  way  we  set  wages.  The  National  Wage  Case  of  December  1970 resulted in a 6 per cent increase in awards, and the metals industry award of July 1971 added 9 per cent to award wages through that year (when inflation was 5.1 per cent).\n\nDiagram 4\n\n## Consumer Prices\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  point  of  all  this  analysis  is  to  answer  the  second  proposition  that  was presented in the Introduction. Was the world achieving good macro-economic performance until hit by the OPEC shocks? The answer is clearly no. In the period after 1965, policies became too ambitious and too expansionary. In colloquial terms, we all lost the plot. Of course, it is easy for\n\nme to say these things now because I have the benefit of hindsight - it was much harder at the time to see that we were overstretching ourselves.\n\nBy 1973, the world economy already had an entrenched inflationary problem, not just  a  temporary  one  as  in  the  Korean  War  period.  Whether  OPEC  had  come  along  or  not,  it would still have been necessary to re-examine demand management policies and do something about restoring the sort of conditions that existed in the 1945-65 period. History shows that what we got instead was an oil price shock to add to our already considerable self-imposed troubles, and so spent the next decade-and-a-half trying to return to some sort of reasonable equilibrium. I do not want to say anything about that period because that is another story.\n\n## 5.  Conclusion\n\nThe  period  that  is  loosely  described  as  the  1950s  and  1960s  really  covers  the nearly  three  decades  between  the  end  of  the  Second  World  War  and  the  first  oil  price  shock known as OPEC I. Macro-economic policies were successful for most of this time in that they avoided  the  deflation  that  had  characterised  the  1930s,  and  yet  did  not  move  too  far  in  the inflationary direction.\n\nHowever, a closer examination of the whole period suggests that there were two quite distinct sub-periods. The first, from 1945 to 1965 or thereabouts, was the true Golden Age in  that  sustainable  growth  with  low  inflation  was  achieved  against  a  background  of  macroeconomic policies that did not try to be too ambitious in the short run. The second period, from 1965 to 1973, looked promising for a time, but was ultimately a period of policy failure. Macroeconomic policy tried to achieve too much and forgot about the need for sustainability. It ended up with the world economy in an inflationary boom, which set the scene for oil prices to rise sharply, as had all other commodity prices during the boom. A policy reversal aimed at restoring the more balanced approach of the 1945-65 period would have been needed even without the shock of OPEC.\n\n***************\n\n## Bibliography\n\nAustralian  Bureau  of  Statistics, Government  Financial  Statistics,  Cat.

         "Testimony of the Chairman of the Board of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the US House of Representatives on 13/2/97.",
         "Mr. Greenspan presents the views of the Federal Reserve Board on some broad issues associated with financial modernization Testimony of the Chairman of the Board of the US Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the US House of Representatives on 13/2/97.\n\nMadam Chairwoman, members of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, it is a pleasure to appear here today to present the views of the Federal Reserve Board on some broad issues associated with financial modernization. The unremitting pressures of technology and the market are drastically changing the financial landscape and eroding traditional positions of competitors, inducing new competitive strategies and participants, forcing new regulatory responses, and building pressures on the Congress to shape developments in the public interest.\n\nMadam Chairwoman, I know that you have been an active sponsor and supporter of legislation to modernize the financial system. The Board also has been a strong proponent both of expanded financial activities for banking organizations and enhanced opportunities for nonbank financial institutions to enter banking. We continue to support financial modernization because we believe it would provide improved financial services for our citizens. Moreover, both our experience and analysis suggest that the additional risks of new financial products are modest and manageable. Indeed, technology already has resulted in a blurring of product and service-defining lines so dramatic as to make many financial products virtually indistinguishable from each other and the old rules inapplicable. In the process, we have already seen the public benefits, benefits that removal of old barriers could only enhance.\n\nBut, as we proceed down the path of reform, reforms both desired for their benefits to the public and required by global markets and new technologies, the Board urges that any modifications be tested against certain standards. In particular, the Board believes that the changes we adopt should be consistent with (1) continuing the safety and soundness of the banking system; (2) limiting systemic risks; (3) contributing to macroeconomic stability; and (4) limiting the spread of both the moral hazard and the subsidy implicit in the safety net.\n\nThus, if my comments today sound cautious, I want the subcommittee to understand that my observations do not reflect opposition to further freeing of constraints on financial competition. To the contrary. We strongly urge an extensive increase in the activities permitted to banking organizations and other financial institutions, provided these activities are financed at nonsubsidized market rates and do not pose unacceptable risks to our financial system. While a level playing field requires broader powers, it does not require subsidized ones.\n\n## Safety Net Implications\n\nIn this century the Congress has delegated the use of the sovereign credit --the power to create money and borrow unlimited funds at the lowest possible rate --to support the banking system. It has done so indirectly as a consequence of deposit insurance, Federal Reserve discount window access, and final riskless settlement of payment system transactions. The public policy purpose was to protect depositors, stem bank runs, and lower the level of risk to the financial system from the insolvency of individual institutions. In insuring depositors, the government, through the FDIC, substituted its unsurpassable credit rating for those of banks. Similarly, provisions of the Federal Reserve Act enabled banks to convert illiquid assets, such as loans, into riskless assets (deposits at the central bank) through the discount window, and to\n\ncomplete payments using Federal Reserve credits. All these uses of the sovereign credit have dramatically improved the soundness of our banking system and the public's confidence in it.\n\nIn the process, it has profoundly altered the risks and returns in banking. Sovereign credit guarantees have significantly reduced the amount of capital that banks and other depositories need to hold, since creditors demand less of a buffer to protect themselves from the failure of institutions that are the beneficiaries of such guarantees. In different language, these entities have been able to operate with a much higher degree of leverage --that is, to obtain more of their funds from other than the owners of the organization --than virtually all other financial institutions. At the same time, depositories have been able to take greater risk in their portfolios than would otherwise be the case, because private creditors --depositors and others --are less affected by the illiquidity of, or losses on, the banks' portfolios. The end result has been a higher risk-adjusted rate of return on depository institution equity.\n\nMoreover, the enhanced ability to take risk has contributed to economic growth, while the discount window and deposit insurance have contributed to our macroeconomic stability. But all good things have their price. The use of the sovereign credit in banking --even its potential use --creates a moral hazard that distorts the incentives for banks: the banks determine the level of risk-taking and receive the gains therefrom, but do not bear the full costs of that risk. The remainder of the risk is transferred to the government. This then creates the necessity for the government to limit the degree of risk it absorbs by writing rules under which banks operate, and imposing on these entities supervision by its agents --the banking regulators --to assure adherence to these rules. The experience in the 1980s with many insured thrift institutions showed just how dangerous lax enforcement of supervisory rules can be. In the end, some hard lessons were learned, many of which were legislated into the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991.\n\nThe subsidy to the banking and other depositories created by the use of the unsurpassable sovereign credit rating of the United States government is an undesirable but unavoidable consequence of creating a safety net. Indeed, one measure of the effectiveness of a safety net is our ability to minimize the subsidy and limit its incidence outside of the area to which it was directed. Some of the value of the subsidy has been passed to depositors of, and borrowers from, banks, for example, as well as to the original bank shareholders. But, the United States government has been remarkably successful in containing the value of most of the subsidy within depository institutions. The bank holding company organizational structure has, on balance, provided an effective means of limiting the use of the sovereign credit subsidy by other parts of the banking organization. To be sure, bank holding companies have indirectly benefited from the subsidy because their major assets are subsidiary banks. The value of the subsidy given to the subsidiary banks has no doubt been capitalized in part into the share prices of holding companies and has improved their debt ratings, lowering their cost of capital. But, holding companies also own nonsubsidized entities that have no direct access to the safety net. Accordingly, both bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries have a higher cost of capital than banks.\n\nThis is clear in the debt ratings of bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies, which are virtually always higher than those of their parent holding companies. Moreover, existing law and regulation under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act require that any credit extended by a bank to its parent or affiliate not only be totally collateralized and subject to quantitative limits, but also be extended at arms-length and at market rates, making a direct transfer of the safety net subsidy difficult.\n\nIt is true that a bank could pay dividends from its earnings, earnings which have been enhanced by the safety net subsidy, to fund its parent's nonbank affiliates. However, the evidence appears to be that such transfers generally do not occur. Existing holding company powers are limited and do not offer a broad spectrum of profitable opportunities. Accordingly, it is not surprising that data for the top 50 bank holding companies indicate that transfers from bank subsidiaries to their parents which, like dividends, embody the subsidy, appear to have approximately equaled holding company net transfers to their own shareholders and long-term creditors. This indicates that few subsidized dollars in the aggregate found their way into the equity accounts of holding company nonbank affiliates from the upstreaming of bank funds.\n\nWe must, I think, be continually on guard that the subsidy provided by the safety net does not leak outside the institutions for which it was intended and provide a broad subsidy to other kinds of activities. Put another way, we must remain especially vigilant in maintaining a proper balance between a safety net that fosters economic and financial stabilization and one that benefits the competitive position of private businesses for no particular public purpose. As I noted, safety net subsidies have costs in terms of distorted incentives and misallocated resources. That is why the Congress must be cautious in how the sovereign credit is used.\n\nIt has been suggested that the bank holding company structure imposes inefficiencies on banking organizations, and that these organizations should thus be given the option of conducting expanded financial activities in a direct subsidiary of the bank. The bank subsidiary may be a marginally more efficient way of delivering such services, but we believe it cannot avoid being a funnel for transferring the sovereign credit subsidy directly from the bank to finance the new powers, thereby imparting a subsidized competitive advantage to the subsidiary of the bank. One can devise rules --such as 23A and 23B --to assure that loans from the bank to its own subsidiaries are limited and at market rates. One can even devise rules to limit the aggregate equity investment made by banks in their subsidiaries. But one cannot eliminate the fact that the equity invested in subsidiaries is funded by the sum of insured deposits and other bank borrowings that directly benefit from the subsidy of the safety net. Thus, inevitably, a bank subsidiary must have lower costs of capital than an independent entity and even a subsidiary of the bank's parent. Indeed, one would expect that a rational banking organization would, as much as possible, shift its nonbank activity from the bank holding company structure to the bank subsidiary structure. Such a shift from affiliates to bank subsidiaries would increase the subsidy and the competitive advantage of the entire banking organization relative to its nonbank competitors.\n\nI am aware that these are often viewed as only highly technical issues, and hence ones that are in the end, of little significance. I do not think so. The issue of the use of the sovereign credit is central to how our financial system will allocate credit, and hence real resources, the kinds of risk it takes, and the degree of supervision it requires. If the Congress wants to extend the use of the sovereign credit further, to achieve a wider range over which the benefits of doing so can accrue, it ought to make that decision explicitly, and accept the consequences of the subsidy on the financial system that come with it. But, it should not, in the name of some technical change, or in search of some minor efficiency, inadvertently expand the use of the sovereign credit. This issue would not be so important were we not in the process of addressing what must surely be a watershed in the revamping of our regulatory structure. We must avoid inadvertently extending the safety net and its associated subsidy without a thorough understanding of the implications of such an extension to the competitive balance and systemic risks of our financial system.\n\nCentral to the Board's choice of a financial structure is its desire for one that will be most effective in fostering both a viable financial system and a vibrant economy. These objectives, in our view, would be thwarted if the safety net subsidy directly benefited new activities. With the safety net comes the moral hazard of which I spoke earlier, and its attendant misallocation of resources, and uneven competitive playing field. If the government subsidies directed to banks were channeled to bank subsidiaries, in my judgement, both the benefits and enumerated costs to the financial system and the public would occur.\n\nIf banks were permitted to engage in new activities in their own subsidiaries, inevitably virtually all holding companies would shift those activities now conducted in holding company affiliates to bank subsidiaries, eviscerating the holding company structure. Were such shifts to happen solely as the result of operational efficiencies, no one, including the Board, should mourn the demise of the holding company. But if, as I suspect, such shifts occurred because of the attraction of a government subsidy, we should be concerned because the insidious effects of such subsidies would have spread. The evidence from flows between banks and their parents, relative bond ratings, and the administration of Sections 23A and B of the Federal Reserve Act, all strongly suggest that the holding company structure is far more capable of containing the sovereign credit subsidy whose purpose is support of the safety net, not providing expanded competitive advantage.\n\nAs new activities hopefully expand for banking organizations, we believe that it is essential that we assure they are financed at market rates, not subsidized ones. This will not always be easy. Containment of subsidies is often implemented through firewalls and other devices which could also inhibit the very synergies which the expansion of activities is meant to achieve. But we have dealt with these trade-offs before and should be able to in the future as well.\n\n## Umbrella Supervision\n\nWhether new activities are authorized in bank subsidiaries, bank holding companies, or both, Congress, in its review of financial modernization, must consider legal entity supervision versus umbrella supervision. The Board believes that umbrella supervision is a realistic necessity for the protection of our financial system and to limit any misuse of the sovereign credit.\n\nThe bank holding company organization is increasingly being managed so as to take advantage of the synergies between its component parts in order to deliver better products to the market and higher returns to stockholders. Such synergies cannot occur if the model of the holding company is one in which the parent is just, in effect, a portfolio investor in its subsidiary. Indeed, virtually all of the large holding companies now operate as integrated units and are managed as such.\n\nAs bank holding companies began to widen their activities, and as new technologies permitted not only the development of new products but also the systems for controlling them, the banking organization was impelled to develop centralized risk control techniques that crossed legal entities. Today, risk management for the entire company is increasingly centralized not only at the larger and more sophisticated banking organizations, but at other large financial services providers as well. This development reflects the demands of the marketplace, which views banks and their affiliates and other financial businesses and their affiliates as integrated organizations in terms of financial condition, management, and reputation.\n\nTo understand the risk controls of the bank, we have first to come to grips with the fact that the organization is interested in risk and its control, not by instrument or legal entity, but for the entire business. This type of control is being adopted by more and more organizations each year, and can only increase as more activities are authorized by the regulators and the Congress. Regulatory policies and operating procedures have had to respond to these realities, to focus on the process of decisionmaking for the total organization. Thus, the Federal Reserve --the historical umbrella supervisor --also has found it necessary to concentrate more on the process that banking organizations use to manage market, credit, operating and exchange rate risk, and less on the traditional after-the-fact evaluation of balance sheets that can and often do change dramatically the day after they have been reviewed by the supervisors. In such a world, process, if not everything, is critical, and that process is determined increasingly at the parent holding company for all of the units of the organization on a consolidated basis.\n\nOne could argue --as several witnesses appearing before this subcommittee did on Tuesday --that regulators should only be interested in the entities they regulate and, hence, review the risk evaluation process only as it relates to their regulated entity. Presumably each regulator of each entity --the bank regulators, the SEC, the state insurance and finance company authorities --would look only at how the risk management process affected their units. It is our belief that this simply will not be adequate. Risks managed on a consolidated basis cannot be reviewed on an individual legal entity basis by different supervisors.\n\nIndeed, our experience has been that a problem in one legal entity can have a contagion effect in other entities. If a bank affiliate begins to have difficulty, the market evaluates the problem as the consolidated entity's problem and can bring pressure on all the units. These pressures usually take the form of funding or liquidity difficulties, as creditors seek to reduce their exposure to all units of an organization that seems to be having trouble. Better safe than sorry. Indeed, it is in the cauldron of the payments and settlement system, where decisions involving large sums must be made in short periods, that this contagion effect might be first seen as participants understandably seek to protect themselves from the uncertainty that accompanies this contagion effect. And that is how crises often begin.\n\nThese concerns were part of the motivation for the congressional decision just five years ago to require that foreign banks could enter the United States if, and only if, they were subject to consolidated supervision. This decision, which is consistent with the international standards for consolidated supervision of banking organizations, was a good decision then. It is a good decision today, especially for those banking organizations whose disruption could cause major financial disturbances in United States and foreign markets. For foreign and for U.S. banking organizations, retreat from consolidated supervision would, the Board believes, be a significant step backward.\n\nWe have to be careful, however, that consolidated umbrella supervision does not inadvertently so hamper the decisionmaking process of banking organizations as to render them ineffectual. The Federal Reserve Board is accordingly in the process of reviewing its supervisory structure and other procedures in order to reflect the aforementioned market-directed shift from conventional balance sheet auditing to evaluation of the internal risk management process. Although focused on the key risk management processes, it would sharply reduce routine supervisory umbrella presence in holding companies. As the committee knows, the Board has recently published for comment proposals to expedite the applications process, and the legislation Congress enacted last year eased such procedures as well. Nonetheless, the Board requests even greater modification to its existing statutory mandate so that the required\n\napplications process could be sharply cut back, particularly in the area of nonbank financial services.\n\nWe would hope that should the Congress authorize wider activities for financial services holding companies that it recognize that a bank which is a minor part of such an organization (and its associated safety net) can be protected through adequate bank capital requirements and the application of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. The case is weak, in our judgment, for umbrella supervision of a holding company which, because it owns only a small bank, does not have material access to the safety net.\n\nAs I noted when discussing the safety net and bank subsidiaries, attached to all uses of the sovereign credit come efforts by the government to protect the taxpayer. Those entities interested in banks are really interested in access to the safety net, since it is far easier to engage in the nonsafety net activities of banks without acquiring a bank. If an organization chooses to deliver some of its services with the aid of the sovereign credit by acquiring a bank, it should not be excused from efforts of the government to look out for the stability of the overall financial system. For bank holding companies that own more than a small bank, this implies umbrella supervision. Although that process will increasingly be designed to reduce supervisory presence and be as nonintrusive as possible, umbrella supervision should not be eliminated, but recognized for what it is: the cost of obtaining a subsidy.\n\n## Banking and Commerce\n\nFinally, let me turn to an issue that has bedeviled supervisory and regulatory discussions for years: the potential separation of commerce and banking.\n\nAs I indicated earlier, it is clear that rapidly changing technologies are altering the nature of what constitutes finance. Indeed, just as the lines between banking and other financial institutions are often already difficult to discern, the boundaries between finance and nonfinance are likely to become increasingly indistinct as we move into the 21st century. For example, computer and software firms will certainly be offering ever more sophisticated financial products. And doubtless financial firms will be offering an increasingly sophisticated array of nonfinancial services. In addition, some of the financial firms who mainly produce products and services that many observers believe should be permissible to banks are also engaged in, or affiliated with, nonfinancial businesses.\n\nNewer technologies will make it highly unlikely that the walling off of any ownership of financial institutions by nonfinancial businesses and vice-versa can be continued very far into the 21st century. Nonetheless, the Board has concluded that it would be wise to move with caution in addressing the removal of the current legal barriers between commerce and banking. The free and open legal association of banking and commerce would be a profound and surely irreversible structural change in the American economy. Hence, we must be careful to assure ourselves that whatever changes are made in our supervisory structure, that it not distort our evolution to the most efficient financial structure as we move into the next century.\n\nWere we fully confident of how the structure would evolve, we could presumably construct today the regulations which would foster that evolution. But we cannot be certain. We thus run the risk of locking in a set of inappropriate regulations that could adversely alter the development of market structures. We cannot be confident we know what the true synergies between finance and nonfinance will be in ten or even five years. Our ability to foresee accurately the future implications of technologies and market developments in banking, as in\n\nother industries, has not been particularly impressive. As Professor Rosenberg of Stanford University has pointed out, \". . . mistaken forecasts of future structure litter our financial landscape.\" Consider the view of the 1960s that the \"cashless society\" was imminent. Nonetheless, the public preference for paper has declined only gradually. Similarly, just a few years ago conventional wisdom argued that banks were dinosaurs that were becoming extinct. The reality today is far from it. Even more recently, it was argued that banks and nonfinancial firms had to merge in order to save the capital-starved banking system. Today, as you know, virtually all of our banks are very well capitalized.\n\nAll these examples suggest that if we change the rules now about banking and commerce under circumstances of uncertainty about future synergies between finance and nonfinance, we might end up doing more harm than good. And, as with all rule changes by government, we are likely to find it impossible to correct our errors promptly. Modifications of such a fundamental structural rule as the separation of banking and commerce should accordingly proceed at a deliberate pace, testing the response of markets and technological innovation to the altered rules in the years ahead. The public needs to have confidence in the regulatory structure, implying that we proceed slowly and cautiously.\n\nExcessive delay, however, would doubtless produce some inequities. Expanded financial activities for banking organizations requires, the Board believes, that those firms operating in markets that banks can enter should, in turn, be authorized to engage in banking. However, some of these nonbanking financial firms already own --or are owned by --nonfinancial entities. A complete commerce and banking prohibition would thus require the divestiture of all nonfinancial activities by those organizations that wanted to acquire or establish banks. The principle of caution suggests an approach which may prove useful. Perhaps those organizations that either have or establish well-capitalized and well-managed bank subsidiaries should be permitted a small basket of nonfinancial assets --a certain percentage of either consolidated assets or capital. A small permissible basket would establish, in effect, a pilot program to evaluate the efficacy of further breaching of the banking and commerce wall. We found that such a slow and deliberate policy worked well with Section 20 affiliates.\n\nOf course, some nonbanking firms would find that their nonfinancial activities would exceed a small basket exemption. Such excess nonconforming assets might be addressed on a case-by-case basis with a scheduled longer-term divestiture to avoid the worst short-term inequities. A basket clause plus case-by-case review of individual situations might also provide a way to make available a common bank and thrift charter to those unitary thrifts that are affiliated with nonfinancial businesses. The Board has no firm opinion on just exactly how such trade-offs might be made, constrained only by the general concerns I summarized earlier.",

         "Address by the Vice-President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Herr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, to the 32nd Conference of the Governors of South-East Asian Central Banks in Bangkok on 13/2/97.",
         "Herr Gaddum gives his views on the challenges facing European central banks in the light of EMU Address by the Vice-President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Herr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, to the 32nd Conference of the Governors of South-East Asian Central Banks in Bangkok on 13/2/97.\n\nI consider it a great honour to be invited to speak at the Conference of the Governors of South-East Asian Central Banks. Professor Tietmeyer was glad to receive your invitation and took it up with pleasure. He regrets very much that he is unable to be here.\n\nWe regard the contacts and dialogue within the global central bank community as being most important and valuable. In addition, I would rate your invitation as being a reflection of your interest in Europe, and in economic and monetary developments there. Conversely, I can assure you that European interest in Asia has increased tremendously in recent years.\n\nWe are full of admiration for your cultural and economic achievements. We Germans, in particular, are well aware that economic progress is neither a miracle nor a matter of luck. Economic success has to do with wise policy decisions. And it also has to do with the capabilities and industry of human beings.\n\nThe present day and age is distinguished by progressive economic integration. It is taking place on two levels. The one level is regional integration. In many parts of the world the regions are moving more closely together. This is mostly due to economic factors: creating larger markets and free-trade areas, and structuring the division of labour more effectively. In Europe the economic motives are combined with political ones. The peoples of Europe have learned from past conflicts.\n\nBesides the economic merging, European integration is designed to help forestall tensions between countries and reconcile diverging interests. Incidentally, regional integration is celebrating anniversaries this year, both here in South-East Asia and in Europe. ASEAN will be thirty years old this year, and the European Union forty.\n\nThe other level of integration is globalisation, which is galloping ahead. Here, several factors are combining and mutually reinforcing one another:\n\n- -the internal decisions many countries have taken to open up their markets,\n- -the easing of restrictions on multilateral trade and,\n- -in particular, the huge technological advances in telecommunications and data processing.\n\nUndoubtedly, one of the major challenges facing policy makers worldwide is that of fostering regional and global integration side by side, rather than in opposition to one another. It is a matter -as we say in German -of doing the one without failing to do the other. In the triangular global political relationship between Asia, North America and Europe, the transatlantic community between the European Union and North America, on the one hand, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), on the other, already have an important part to play. I hope and confidently expect that in future the Asian-European link in this triangle will increase in significance. An important initial step in this direction was the first European-Asian Summit Meeting of Heads of State and Government here in Bangkok just under a year ago.\n\nThe two levels of integration are currently determining to a very large extent the work of European central banks. The challenges posed by the global markets are affecting all central banks worldwide in much the same way. But the tasks faced in the context of regional integration in Europe are unique.\n\nAfter all, under the Treaty of Maastricht Europe has set itself the target of a monetary union before the end of this century. The present year will be of crucial importance on the road to that goal. The timetable envisaged is as follows: the countries that will participate in the monetary union from the start will be ascertained in spring 1998. The participating countries will have to fulfil the following criteria, in particular:\n\n- -stable monetary conditions as regards the value of money, the exchange rate and the longer-term interest rate level,\n- -lastingly sustainable public finance, and\n- -an independent national central bank.\n\nWhich countries that will be, will become manifest after the examination and decision next spring. To date, there have been forecasts, as well as some wishful thinking. But decisions or preliminary decisions have not been taken yet.\n\nMonetary union is due to begin in 1999. At that date the participating countries will irrevocably fix the exchange rates of their currencies and introduce the euro. From the first day onwards, the European Central Bank will assume full responsibility for monetary policy. National central banks will become members of the European System of Central Banks. On the basis of the decisions taken by the European Central Bank, they will then implement monetary policy decentrally (insofar as that is possible).\n\nWhereas the financial markets are expected to use the euro from as early as 1999, retail business is likely to go on using national currencies at first. This is because banknotes and coins denominated in euros are not due to be issued until the beginning of the year 2002. Without any doubt, the monetary union is an ambitious project. It implies, from the first day onwards, irrevocably fixed exchange rates between the participating countries and a single monetary policy; that is to say, a common central bank, identical central bank rates for all countries, a virtually uniform arsenal of policy instruments and much more besides. The euro will be a supranational currency. The single monetary policy will apply -unlike the situation in most other monetary areas -to several states that in other respects remain sovereign.\n\nOn the one hand, the introduction of the euro will present new opportunities for integration. The economies of the participating countries will be able to grow more closely together. The Common Market will be afforded a new dimension. On the other hand, in order to realise the benefits, the euro area will have to fulfil two main conditions: First, the participating countries will have to be able (both economically and in terms of anti-inflation policy) permanently to relinquish the instrument of exchange rate adjustment relative to one another. And, second, the differing national traditions and structures which the countries bring into the monetary union will have to grow into a single whole. For instance, some countries have different policy traditions on issues such as:\n\n- -what part can and should monetary policy play in the real economy?\n\n- -which target has priority in the event of a conflict between domestic price stability and external exchange rate stability?\n\nIn addition, national central banks have divergent backgrounds as regards their relations with the government and their standing in the eyes of the general public. In some cases, they also have different policy instruments, deployed in different ways. By such means, they have taken due account of the differing structures of the domestic banking system.\n\nEstablishing a monetary union implies building sustainable bridges across these differences. The single currency calls for joint answers to the underlying issues of monetary policy. The prerequisites are being elaborated at three levels: First, the choice of the participants at the start of monetary union is vitally important. This is to ensure that the range of countries remains fairly homogeneous overall with respect to their maturity for anti-inflation policy. Second, the Treaty of Maastricht laid down the independence of the European Central Bank and of all the central banks participating in monetary union. The statute of the European Central Bank defines ensuring price stability as its priority target. In this way the Treaty gives an unambiguous answer to the question of the fundamental orientation of the future monetary union. It is designed as a community of stability. And third, the European Monetary Institute, as a forerunner of the European Central Bank, has been working in Frankfurt for three years now.\n\n## Il\n\nUnder the auspices of the European Monetary Institute, we are preparing the organisational and technical framework for the decision on the single monetary policy and its implementation.\n\nThe preparatory work makes up a long list:\n\n- -First of all, a strategy for harmonised monetary statistics was drawn up.\n- -Central banks are working together with the European Monetary Institute on the introduction of a real time gross settlement system (TARGET).\n- -The EMI Council has already decided on the design of the future euro banknotes.\n- -In its Framework Report, the European Monetary Institute has recently mapped out a framework for the future strategy and the arsenal of policy instruments.\n\nThe policy instruments will be geared to market conditions, transparent and efficient. Open market operations will be at the centre of refinancing policy. Two standard tenders are envisaged: one tender running for two weeks (that will be the most important instrument), accompanied by a second tender running for three months. In the case of the longer-term tender, national central banks, when assessing the eligibility of collateral, are to have the option of taking national financing patterns into account. Two standing facilities are available for providing or absorbing overnight liquidity. They form a corridor for the rate for day-to-day money and signal the prevailing monetary policy stance.\n\nIn the shape of the Framework Report, the European Monetary Institute has already laid down a number of benchmarks for future European monetary policy. However, it cannot take all decisions away from the European Central Bank. This is because the ultimate decision on the strategy and the actual deployment of the policy instruments remains, of course,\n\nin the hands of the European Central Bank. After all, it bears the responsibility and must take the final decision. Hence, where there is still no consensus on the EMI Council, the decision remains pending for the time being. That applies, for instance, to the strategy. The Framework Report provides for an alternative between a two-tier strategy, with a monetary aggregate as the intermediate target, and the single-tier strategy of a direct inflation target.\n\nThe Bundesbank strongly advocates the monetary targeting approach. Needless to say, we also recognise that managing a monetary aggregate is becoming more difficult under the conditions presented by current financial markets. But the European Central Bank could demonstrate its responsibility more clearly and more transparently by means of the monetary targeting strategy. And the virtual adoption of the strategy of the erstwhile anchor currency Deutsche Mark would be a token of continuity.\n\nAnother unresolved question, for example, is the issue of minimum reserves. The European Monetary Institute is preparing the option. Then the European Central Bank will have to decide at a later date whether minimum reserves will be adopted, and in which form. In future, a great deal will depend on the European Central Bank. Many people are pinning their hopes and expectations of a stable euro on its independence and steadfastness.\n\nThe biggest challenge facing the European Central Bank lies in its need to earn the requisite reputation and credibility as quickly as possible. This is in order to justify people's hopes of a stable euro. And to enable it to weather the test to be expected from the global financial markets.\n\n## IV\n\nThe environment in which central banks (and other economic policy makers, too) operate has undergone a radical change in the last decade.\n\n- -We are witnessing economic developments in the markets: professionalisation of investors, globalisation of financial markets.\n- -We are witnessing political reforms: deregulation of the domestic markets, liberalisation of border-crossing capital movements.\n- -We are witnessing technological breakthroughs in information and communications technology.\n\nAll these changes are interacting, reinforcing one another and constituting a new real world. This upheaval presents great opportunities. The international capital markets can operate more efficiently. Market transparency is increasing. Greater diversification of investment may help to allocate capital more effectively, in line with its marginal productivity. Risk management is becoming more efficient. The financial markets are better able to perform their transformation function. The markets are better able to reconcile savers' and investors' preferences with respect to maturities, batch sizes and risks.\n\nNowadays the financial markets perform a monitoring function all around the clock. Those markets test countries' policies. They scrutinise the lasting sustainability of public finance. They scrutinise the gearing of monetary policy to stability. Where they register doubt, they are able to penalise massively by siphoning off capital and imposing high capital market rates. Hence the financial markets, in their monitoring and sanctionative capacity, figure as valuable allies of a monetary policy geared to stability.\n\nAt the same time, however, the financial markets often appear to give cause for concern. Many people are suspicious of the financial markets' power. For the financial markets increasingly seem to be divesting themselves of the \"subservient role\" they are supposed to play. Such fears apply, for one thing, to the relations of the global financial markets with national monetary, economic and fiscal policy. Anonymous market forces constrict policy makers' national room for manoeuvre. This may lead to tensions because domestic policy-making normally claims to be sovereign. But, at least insofar as the financial markets thereby lessen the scope for a monetary policy that is detrimental to stability and a fiscal policy that inflates debt, the economist will not deplore that fact unduly. For a policy that fosters inflation and exacerbates national debt widens scope, at the most, for a temporary period; in the longer run, any such scope is narrowed.\n\nBut there is a second dimension to the misgivings that the financial markets are no longer duly performing their subservient function. That relates to the relations with the real economy. In itself, a high volatility of financial market prices may affect real economic decisions. For example, enterprises may increasingly switch to hedging against the risk of sharply fluctuating exchange rates not only by means of financial contracts such as currency futures, but also by diversifying the locations, in terms of different currency areas.\n\nProlonged distortions, such as misalignments of exchange rates or bubbles in asset prices, are all the more problematic. It is not only that the financial markets distort real relationships. The relevant adjustments are often sudden and violent, as in the case of the European Monetary System early in the nineties, or of Mexico. It is precisely such crisis-like upheavals that prompt the question of whether and, if so, to what extent today's financial markets have become more unstable, and whether systemic risk has increased?\n\nSome people fear that the advance of professionalism among fund managers and institutional investors, in particular, might increase the incidence of such dangers. Their thinking is determined primarily by the short-term performance of their portfolio. In certain situations, that may intensify the \"herd instinct\", triggering a \"rush to the exit\". At the same time, new financial instruments make it easier for them to incur higher risk positions. Swings in sentiment may then lead all the more easily to precarious situations.\n\nOn the other hand, the greater international diversification of investments makes the markets fundamentally more resilient today. Furthermore, owing to the increased significance of the funds, relative to that of the banks, the creditor pattern is nowadays much more heterogeneous and more diversified. That reduces the risk of chain reactions. If the banks are less heavily involved, the danger of a liquidity crisis impairing the viability of the payment and settlement system decreases. After all, not every liquidity crisis poses a systemic risk.\n\nVv\n\nCentral banks -like other economic policy makers -must adjust to the reality represented by the global financial markets. That applies to all policy areas: monetary policy, exchange rate policy, banking supervision. Problematic developments in the financial markets are not as a rule exclusively inherent in those markets. They often also have to do with current or earlier policy decisions. Monetary policy itself must not be an uncertainty factor that fosters volatility. It must focus on continuity, must build confidence. Continuity, consistency, credibility -the three Cs denote the right direction.\n\nTo be sure, a medium-term monetary policy geared to continuity is not always easy to pursue, with the present-day financial markets and their frequent volatility as a counterpart. But there is no alternative. By and large, a steady, sound policy stance is easier for an independent central bank, which is at least spared the turmoil of day-to-day politics. Its guiding principle for exchange rate policy must be: it must not set unrealistic objectives. It must take great care not to provide the markets with triggering points; that is to say, points on which the entire credibility of a system or a policy hinges. Then, the markets can undertake a test.\n\nAnd its guiding principle for banking supervision must be: financial conglomeration and market globalisation, in particular, call for closer cooperation in the field of banking supervision between the responsible national authorities and between the international supervisory bodies for banking, insurance and securities operations. This applies even if a complete restructuring of a supervisory regime outside the existing patterns of supervision is unlikely to be implemented in the foreseeable future. Present-day supervision does not seek to push the market into the background, but rather to reinforce it. Competition is meant to discipline. Supervision is not intended to get bogged down in details, but to draw up a few key rules. Risks must be covered. A minimum of transparency must be present.\n\nAbove all, the sanctionative mechanism of the markets must continue to work. There must not be any bailing-out that fosters moral hazard. Banking supervision seeks to enhance competition. It is therefore not merely a matter of lessening systemic risk. It is also a matter of identical competitive conditions, along the lines of \"same business, same risks, same rules\". I am glad that the banking supervisory authorities are now working together in Basle beyond the range of the G-10 countries alone. Although the responsibility will remain at national level in future, the closer international cooperation among national supervisory authorities will improve mutual information, in addition to devising common standards.\n\nVI\n\nInformation and communication: these are the keywords for the interaction of the markets and for the globalisation of business. To my mind, information and communication must also be the keywords for collaboration among central banks; naturally at the regional level, and particularly at the global level, too. In this context, I continue to believe that the G-10 is a forum that is useful and has proved its worth. But, needless to say, global collaboration must be much more broadly based. It should encompass all major players. It is this conviction that has recently prompted the BIS to invite a number of central banks from South-East Asia to become new members.\n\nFurthermore, the G-10 working parties -the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, the Euro-Currency Standing Committee, and the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems -have invited representatives of non-G-10 countries, in order increasingly to address questions connected with the emerging markets. At the same time, the Governors have enlarged their meetings in Basle. Non-members of the BIS are also being invited to take part in the informal discussions and make their views known.\n\nThe discussions in Basle cover a wide variety of topics:\n\n- -the instruments, strategy and environment of monetary policy,\n- -questions of foreign exchange reserve policy,\n\n- -recent developments in the markets, such as changes in financial intermediation or electronic money,\n- -and much else besides.\n\nI am sure that such exchanges of views will enhance mutual understanding of the problems and the approaches to solutions. Needless to say, the conditions for central banks are heterogeneous all over the world. But even so -or precisely for that reason -collaboration at a global level may be fruitful. In any case, the globalised markets are pushing all central banks -regardless of their regional affiliation -in the same direction. Not in the sense that all central banks are forced to think or act in the same way. But no matter which actual policies a central bank may pursue, the globalised markets demand a high degree of solidarity. This is a current and future challenge facing every central bank in the world.\n\nBIS Review 18/1997",

         "Text of eighth Gerhard de Kock Memorial Lecture given by the Governor of the Czech National Bank, Mr. Josef Tosovsky, to an audience at the South African Reserve Bank in Pretoria on 17/2/97.",
         "Mr. Tosovsky gives the Czech Republic's perspective of transition in Central and  Eastern  Europe Text  of  eighth  Gerhard  de  Kock  Memorial  Lecture  given  by  the Governor of the Czech National Bank, Mr. Josef Tosovsky, to an audience at the South African Reserve Bank in Pretoria on 17/2/97.\n\nIt is a great honour and pleasure for me to be invited to give the eighth Gerhard de Kock Memorial Lecture, especially as this is probably (if I am not mistaken) the first time that a governor from the reforming countries of Central and Eastern Europe has been afforded this privilege. The region of Central and Eastern Europe has undergone a profound re-shaping. More  than  100  million  people  of  Central  and  Eastern  Europe  got  involved  in  a  far-reaching process  of  political,  economic  and  social  change.  Because  of  its  unprecedented  character  and size  the  impact  of  this  multidimensional  transformation  has  been  in  continent-wide  Europe. Indeed,  the  political  and  economic  map  of  the  whole  of  Europe  is  nowadays  rather  different from what it used to be throughout the postwar period till the 1990s.\n\nLadies  and  gentlemen,  allow  me  to  share  with  you  some  experience  we  have acquired. At the beginning of my lecture I cannot avoid briefly mentioning options for economic and political reforms as opened up for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in the 1990s as  well  as  the  starting  position  of  the  former  Czechoslovakia  on  the  eve  of  the  'velvet revolution' which in November 1989 enabled us to start a process of radical economic reforms.\n\n## Initial conditions for economic reforms\n\nThe task which confronted the countries after the fall of the communist regime was  enormous.  It  involved  radical  change  of  the  whole  political,  institutional,  and  economic system.  Along  with  the  rejection  of  the  communist  one-party  rule,  the  principles  of  the  past economic system, i.e. state ownership of the means of production and the central planning and management of the entire field of economic  activity,  being  entirely  discredited,  were  rejected too. The issue was thus substitution of the previous system and not its reform. The goal was a transition toward a democratic society - and toward a functioning market economy, based on the dominance of private ownership.\n\nThe  respective  move  from  the  Communist  centrally  planned  economy  back towards  a  capitalist  market  economy  implies  a  qualitative  change  in  the  entire  economic  and social regime. As such it is a unique process in modern economic development. The challenge is not  only  to  stabilise,  deregulate  and  liberalise  the  economy,  as  was  the  case  in  countries  with extensive interventions such as Spain or Chile several years ago. The transition in Central and Eastern  Europe  required  basic  institutional,  systemic  as  well  as  socio-political  changes  at  the same  time;  it  is  inevitably  a  multidimensional  process.  It  follows  that,  while  stabilisation programmes and reforms in the other parts of the world economy may provide useful lessons from their experience, there are substantial differences implied both in the initial conditions and in  the  substance  of  the  process.  The  implications  of  that  fact  should  be  remembered  when assessing the course of changes in the previously centrally planned economies. The transition in Central and Eastern Europe is inevitably a much more complex and longer-term phenomenon, for which no generalised theory could be available to apply.\n\nSuch radical  transformation  requires  a  feasible  strategy  implemented  with  wide political  support  of  the  population.  Transformation  requires  some  minimum  speed,  and  must start  with  some  'critical  mass'  of  change  to  secure  sufficient  impact  on  the  behaviour  of economic agents. In individual Central European post-communist countries, the sequence, speed,\n\nand  forms  of  individual  steps  necessarily  differed;  they  had  different  starting  conditions, different  degrees  of  political  support  of  the  new  governments,  and  they  also  applied  different strategies.\n\n## The Czechoslovak case\n\nAt  the  start  of  transformation  in  1990,  Czechoslovakia  had  some  economic advantages over the other Central and East European post-communist countries. In Czechoslovakia, during the preceding decade, state budgets were mostly balanced, foreign debt was  low,  and  the  balance  of  payments  showed  no  big  deficits  or  surpluses.  Inflation  was relatively low. Even if there was an inflationary potential (reflected not only in open inflation but  also  in  the  forms  of  hidden  and  repressed  inflation)  and  the  monetary  overhang  was increasing  in  the  1980s,  its  dimensions  continued  to  be  considerably  lower  than  in  the  other countries  of  Central  and  Eastern  Europe.  Czechoslovakia,  especially  the  Czech  Republic,  also had the advantage of a long industrial history, and of well-educated and skilled labour.\n\nOn the other hand, there were some disadvantages, especially if compared with Poland or Hungary. The system of a command economy was very pervasive in Czechoslovakia. There  was  practically  no  private  sector;  prices  were  centrally  controlled;  enterprise  managers were operating within the limits of a rigid system of central planning, having little autonomy in decision-making.  Market  institutions  were  mostly  lacking,  particularly  in  the  case  of  money, capital  and  labour  markets.  Czechoslovakia  distinguished  itself  also  as  a  country  with  an unfavourably  biased  size  pattern  of  enterprises:  big  units,  mostly  administratively  created, prevailed, while small enterprises were almost lacking. External economic ties were biased as well,  being  monopolised  by  the  state:  exports  were  predominantly  aimed  at  Soviet  and  other communist countries' markets. Especially high was the share of foreign trade  with  the  Soviet Union  (more  than  40%).  Connected  with  this  was  the  fact  that  Czechoslovakia  maintained  a rather large proportion of heavy industries, an extensive but mostly obsolete stock of productive capital, along with underdeveloped services, neglected infrastructure and inadequate environmental protection.\n\nIn coping with the challenge of a system substitution the contraints and even the counterproductiveness of the partial reform approach seemed to be recognised and accounted for in the Czechoslovak case. This was perhaps a lesson learned from the failures of reform attempts in the past.\n\nThere appeared to be a widely shared consensus that a system replacement could hardly be achieved without a sufficient initial 'shock'. Accordingly, the strategy followed aimed at  a  simultaneous  implementation  of  the  package  of  interrelated  measures  in  order  to  secure sufficient impact on the behaviour of economic agents.\n\nGiven  the  above  general  consensus,  there  were,  however,  widely  differentiated stances as regards the contents of the respective 'minimum packages', their sequencing and the speed of their implementation.\n\nIn previous discussions two alternative options - 'fast' and 'slow' movers - used to be identified as a shock therapy approach against a step-by-step, gradualistic or evolutionary type of approach.\n\nThe Czechoslovak scenario opted for a transition path which was implemented as quickly  as  feasible,  implying  some  parallel  features  with  the  shock  therapy  approach,  in particular  with  reference  to  one  stroke,  simultaneous  liberalisation  of  domestic  prices,  foreign trade and foreign exchange, and the introduction of limited currency convertibility (on current account for registered domestic businesses) at the very beginning of the transition process.\n\nThe shock therapy approach was developed for the stabilisation programmes and followed in some countries of Latin America as well as in Poland and former Yugoslavia, where the  dominant  target  of  the  economic  policy  was  to  cope  with  hyperinflation,  to  stabilise  the economy as much and as fast as possible. The initial conditions in the CSFR differed, however, from those of the countries mentioned.\n\n## Strategy of systemic and structural reforms\n\nThe  programme  of  political  and  economic  transformation  was  formed  during 1990,  started  in  January  1991,  and  continued  in  the  Czech  Republic  after  the  split  of Czechoslovakia. From the start, the program included five main parts:\n\n- Macroeconomic stabilisation policies: a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy to remove the monetary overhang and to reintroduce macroeconomic equilibrium.\n- Liberalisation of prices: after 40 years of central price fixing, the bulk of prices\n- were freed.\n-  Liberalisation of external trade  -  and  introduction  of  partial  convertibility  (for resident  firms'  current  account  transactions).  That  required  initial  devaluation  toward  an exchange rate seen as viable from the point of view of the balance of payments.\n- Massive and rapid privatisation, including the use of the voucher scheme.\n-  Social  safety  net  to  protect  people  whose  standard  of  living  dropped  below poverty  line.  These  adverse  impacts  of  economic  transformation  were  to  be  contained  within tolerable limits.\n\nThe  programme  aimed  at  re-establishing  the  role  of  prices  and  markets  for  an efficient allocation of resources. For the start, rationalisation of price relations implied a rise of the price level, owing to a monetary overhang, and to low downward price elasticity. In a small open economy, it made no sense to free internal prices without opening the economy to external competition and to  world  price  relations.  And,  there  could  be  no  meaningful  liberalisation  of imports and exports without current account convertibility, introduced at least for resident firms.\n\nThe short Polish and Hungarian experience showed, however, that free trade and partial convertibility should not be attempted without a preceding macroeconomic stabilisation. The first year of transformation - 1990 - was practically devoted to the stabilisation goal; further transformation steps taken in 1991 were accompanied by continuing stabilising policy. Measures seeking external stability were an indispensable part of the programme. It was understood that the exchange rate would have to be undervalued in relation to purchasing power parity to sustain the liberalised trade and a partly convertible currency and to function as a stabilisation anchor.\n\nCompared  to  steps  such  as  freeing  of  prices,  freeing  of  external  trade,  and introduction  of  partial  convertibility,  it  was  clear  that  privatisation  would  be  a  gradual,  more time-consuming process. First, steps were taken to stop state subsidies to firms (as  well  as  to prices),  and  to  let  the  firms  face  a  hard  budget  constraint;  that  included  also  a  stricter  credit policy by commercial banks. A shift of property rights to private hands was the only way how to\n\nchange fundamentally the behaviour of firms, expose them to the pressures of the market, and initiate productivity increase and structural change.\n\nIn 1989 the private sector was almost non-existent in the former Czechoslovakia, accounting  just  for  3  per  cent  of  GDP.  Domestic  capital  base  was  weak  and  institutions  of market economy such as stack exchange and developed financial sector were lacking. Therefore, a  combination  of  standard  privatisation  methods  (that  means  sales,  including  sales  to  foreign investors) with non-standard ones was used to speed up the process. So called small privatisation (small factories,  real  estate,  retail  stores,  restaurants,  hotels,  repair  shops  etc.)  was  proceeding swiftly  since  early  1991  and  was  more  or  less  accomplished  by  the  end  of  1992.  It  went  by auctions, but also restitution of property to its former owners played a very important part and contributed to the success of the programme.\n\nIn large privatisation (large state-owned enterprises), one part of the property was sold,  another  part  was  distributed  free  of  charge  to  the  entire  population,  through  so-called investment  vouchers.  Standard  methods  such  as  direct  sale,  auctions,  public  tenders,  and transfers  of  property  to  municipalities  were  used  along  with  the  voucher  scheme.  Foreign investors  were,  and  are,  welcome;  in  fact,  the  program  of  rapid  and  mass  privatisation  in  the Czech Republic offered foreign investors an opportunity which will not be repeated in future.\n\nPrivatisation  of  an  almost  fully  state-owned  economy  is  a  task  which  requires years rather than months. Now the bulk of privatisation has been accomplished, and it is starting to influence positively the performance of the economy. Within the last six years the share of private sector jumped from 3 to 75 per cent. But the problem of behaviour of the new owners, and  of  effective  corporate  governance,  is  still  rather  acute  in  the  Czech  Republic.  Special problems are posed by the large ownership of equity by investment funds which emerged during the  voucher  privatisation,  as  well  as  by  large  banks  which  themselves  are  still  partly  in  state hands. Thus, one cannot say that privatisation has been as yet accomplished fully. What remains, however, is a more standard situation, posing similar problems as privatisation of state-owned companies in the advanced market economies. As to the future prevailing model of  corporate governance, the Czech Republic can be expected to converge toward the practice which will be most widely observed within the European Union countries.\n\n## Macroeconomic stabilisation\n\nThe transformation strategy required a constant effort to achieve macroeconomic stabilisation.  Tight  fiscal  policy,  based  on  a  balanced  or  surplus  state  budget,  and  prudent monetary  policy,  were  mutually  supporting  each  other.  These  were  supplemented  by  wage controls  and  overall  income  policy  within  the  so-called  heterodox  concept  of  macroeconomic stabilisation.\n\nDuring  transformation,  Czech  monetary  policy  used  two  basic  tools  to  fight inflation: targeting monetary aggregates, and the nominal anchor of a fixed exchange rate. The Czech experience with curbing inflation during a transformation period is successful, compared to other transforming economies of Central Europe. When, in January 1991, the bulk of prices in the  Czech  economy  were  freed  after  40  years  of  central  price  fixing,  the  result  was  a  yearly increase of the price level by almost 58%. However, no inflationary spiral evolved, and, since 1992, inflation showed a falling long-term trend towards a single digit rate in 1995-1996.\n\nThe  initial  jump  of  prices  in  1991  was  not  accompanied  by  a  similarly  steep increase  of  nominal  wages.  Instead,  real  wages  fell.  That  created  some  room  for  subsequent increases in real wages without serious inflationary consequences. In 1995 and 1996, however, the growth of real wages, which - if aggregated over all sectors - was faster than the increase in productivity, became one of the potential inflationary dangers.\n\nThe nominal anchor of the fixed exchange rate  played  an  important  role  in  the relatively good Czech results in fighting inflation. Instead of repeated smaller devaluations as in Poland or Hungary, the Czech Republic used a combination of a large initial devaluation and a subsequently fixed nominal exchange rate. In 1990 - before the start of the full transformation programme - the currency was devalued by more  than  50%.  That  subsequently  enabled  us  to keep  the  nominal  exchange  rate  stable  for  five  years.  After  the  introduction  of  a  wider  7.5% fluctuation band in 1996, the exchange rate is within the band.\n\nTransformation involved so much fundamental change that its start inevitably led to an initial fall of output and GDP. However, part of the former higher output level was simply feeding the enormous waste which went on throughout the command economy. In 1993, GDP stagnated partly due to  the  split-up  of  Czechoslovakia.  Economic  growth  was  resumed  in  the Czech Republic in 1994 and continued in 1995 and 1996 as a fast growth period.\n\nUnemployment has been kept low during the whole transformation period, thanks mainly  to  the  rapid  emergence  of  new  private  firms,  and  a  large  shift  of  labour  into  the previously  underdeveloped  service  sector.  Even  with  microeconomic  restructuring  going  on, unemployment is not expected to exceed a 4 % level in the near future.\n\n## Monetary policy tools\n\nIn  a  command  type  economy,  monetary  policy  reflected  state  plans  expressed mainly in physical terms. Planned direct credit allocation was linked to the planned growth of national income. Credits to enterprises were directly allocated, with little attention paid to the creditworthiness  of  the  borrowing  enterprise.  Risk  was  socialised  due  to  the  existence  of a unitary banking system.\n\nThe introduction of a new Central Bank Act and a new banking law in late 1989 marked the beginning of the development of a market-oriented banking system. The Act laid the basis for establishing a two-tier banking system through the separation of the central bank and commercial  banking  functions  and  provided  the  central  bank  with  the  means  for  conducting monetary policy and with regulatory authority over banks. The latter established the legal basis for a universal banking system. The separation of central banking from commercial banking was put into effect on January 1, 1990.\n\nThe dissolution of the Czechoslovak Federation into two independent republics on January 1, 1993, meant the creation of the Czech National Bank (CNB). According to the Act, the  CNB is independent of any instructions given by the government. The CNB is obliged to submit  to  the  Parliament  a  report  on  monetary  development  at  least  two  times  a  year  and  to inform the general public on monetary development at least once every three months.\n\nFurther, under this Act the CNB has at its disposal practically all the tools known to advanced market economies.\n\nAt the beginning of the transformation process, the main tools of monetary policy were,  quite  naturally,  direct  ones.  Credit  limits,  interest  rate  ceilings  expressed  as  maximum deviations  from  the  discount  rate  and  refinancing  loans  (in  1991  represented  for  small,  new banks on the average 60 per cent of total sources but for big banks 5-10 per cent  only)  were used.\n\nCredit and interest rate ceilings were abolished in 1992 which can be regarded as a transition year towards indirect control of monetary developments. After credit ceilings on the minor  banks  were  removed  in  April  1992  and  on  the  major  banks  in  October,  central  bank control  of  monetary  developments  was  effected  through  discount  rates,  minimum  reserve requirements, auction refinancing credits and central bank bills.\n\nMy  predecessors  behind  this  chair,  the  governors  of  the  central  banks  from Germany and Switzerland, underlined the role of money supply targets in the kit of tools. In this respect the Czechoslovak and the Czech practice can enrich the experience.\n\nSince 1990 the intermediate targets have been set in the form of planned changes in credits or money. For 1990 the target was 'to keep the development of credits in total within the scope of -2 per cent to +1 per cent related to the level at the end of 1989'. In the following years the starting point for the monetary programme was the expected development of both real GDP and the inflation rate with the corrections for the envisaged changes in income velocity of money (in the Czech terminology the relevant aggregate M2 consists of currency and demand deposits, time and savings deposits and deposits in foreign currency). To be up-to-date, in 1997 we are targeting the increase of money supply by 8-12 per cent.\n\nThe  philosophy  behind  money  supply  targeting  is  well  known.  Without  a  deep reflection upon this theme I recall the message of famous equation of exchange: Total monetary expenditures have to increase proportionally, if the velocity is constant, to nominally expressed GDP. Nothing more and nothing less is required from monetary policy. Monetary policy should serve one goal only: to repress high inflation and provide for a stable currency.\n\nAs  a  rule  of  thumb  this  reasoning  is  both  understandable  and  acceptable  but  a more profound discussion must draw our attention to several points:\n\nNeglecting at this moment the different versions of the equation of exchange what can we understand under the heading 'total physical volume of transactions' on the right side of this  equation?  For  the  economies  in  transition  the  difference  between  the  total  volume  of transactions and transactions counted in national income accounting is important. A part of the transactions is used for intermediate-good or inter-business expenditures and is not counted in the  GDP  accounts.  Some  transactions  are  not  registered  at  all,  for  example,  those  in  the underground economy, some imports and so forth.\n\nThe decomposition of nominal GDP into a change in real output and a change in the  price  level  is  not  a  trivial  exercise  even  in  advanced  market  economies.  But  in  these countries, e.g. in Germany or USA, the prediction of real GDP rests on more solid grounds - one knows approximately what is the 'potential output' as the starting point for some guessing as concerns the development in the medium term. In transition economies, in the period of deep structural changes, the estimate of both real GDP and potential output is much more difficult.\n\nThe traditional unidirectional link from money to income is blurred in advanced market economies by the existence of many forms of financial assets with different degrees of liquidity.\n\nIn  transforming  economies,  the  scope  for  reserve  assets  (Treasury  bills)  and investment assets (bonds, shares) is still  limited  but  is  widening  step  by  step,  thus  weakening also  the  links  between  the  money  stock  and  expenditure  flows.  What  is  probably  even  more important, at least in the Czech Republic, is the financing of receivables and current liabilities through quasi-commercial  credits  (inter-enterprise  indebtedness).  There  is  a  scope,  created  by enterprises  themselves,  for  offsetting  the  potential  effects  of  monetary  stringency  on  spending plans.  A  version  of  the  equation  of  exchange  suitable  for  transforming  economies  should therefore take into account on the left side not only money in the narrow and broader sense but also estimates of different kinds of quasi-credit.\n\nTextbook  knowledge  says  that  the  constancy,  or  at  least  the  predictability  of velocity either in income or in transaction terms, turns the equation of exchange into the quantity theory of money. At this point, last year's speaker, Dr Tietmeyer, had again a more favourable position,  because  he  could  rely  on  the  predictable  and  the  longer-term  change  in  the  income velocity of the German mark. In the Czech Republic the velocity is neither constant nor reliably predictable yet. In the first stage of economic transformation the income velocity declined in line with the increasing transaction demand for money. Only later on did velocity start to stabilise and recently we have observed some increase in velocity.\n\nLast but not least, one must point out that, even in the quantity theory applied in advanced market economies, there is a certain 'black box' connecting the quantity of money on the one hand and its effect on prices and quantities on the other. Between a change in monetary aggregates and offsetting changes in other variables, there is a transmission mechanism, with its specific features determined by the institutional framework in which it operates.\n\nOn the top of it some prices, like housing rents and energy price, are still under the  control  of  the  government  and  the  process  of  deregulation  cannot  be  perfectly  anticipated due to the political implications.\n\nTo specify the transmission mechanism and to open the 'black box' means both to describe and analyse the ways in which money is created and how it influences real variables. These ways change through the evolution of new institutions in transforming economies.\n\nBesides money supply targeting, operative targets have been used.\n\nAs the operative target the monetary base (currency plus minimum reserves plus free  reserves)  was  replaced  in  the  second  half  of  1994  by  bank  reserves  and  a  system  was implemented for the daily prediction of liquidity management on the money market. Since then the monetary base has been used as an indicator.\n\nIn order to reduce the fluctuation of free reserves in the banking system and the volatility of interbank deposit market interest rates, the CNB shortened their maintenance cycle to 14 days commencing March 1st, 1994. Since then refinancing credits have been provided only when fully covered by securities (repo operations). This CNB shift to daily operational monetary policy management based on repo operations and the gradual strengthening of the role of these operations in the sterilisation of foreign capital inflows, particularly in the second half of 1995, led to the repo market's gradual development.\n\nAs from the beginning of 1996 a one-week PRIBOR interest rate replaced bank reserves  management  as  the  operative  target.  The  quantitative  target  has  been  replaced  by  an interest rate target with the aim to efficiently affect, on a daily basis, the interest rate level at the short end of the yield curve. This major change was facilitated by the gradual development of the  money  market  and  its  cultivation  by  the  CNB.  The  one-week  PRIBOR  rate  is  affected through sales of securities with a date specified in advance of their repurchase (repos) with one and two week maturities, for which a limited repo rate is announced.\n\n## New challenge: monetary aggregates in a small open economy\n\nThe  monetary  survey  of  the  CNB  indicates  the  structure  of  the  money  supply (M2) on the liabilities side (corresponding to the demand side) and its sources on the assets side (corresponding to the supply side). By comparing the assets and liabilities, one can reveal the different sources of the money supply.\n\nThe  main  sources  of  money  supply  growth  are  particularly  dependent  on  the specific  conditions  of  each  economy,  reflecting  mainly  the  proportion  of  the  influence  of domestic and foreign sources of growth.\n\nIn general, the main sources of money supply growth include money issued in the form of credits granted by banks to both households and enterprises in domestic currency, the conversion of foreign exchange inflows into domestic currency (net foreign assets), net credit to the government and the net position of the National Property Fund and the residual called 'other items net' (mainly own capital and bank reserves).\n\nDevelopments in the period 1993-1996 reveal some interesting features:\n\nCredits  to  enterprises  and  households  in  domestic  currency,  which  are  quite naturally the main source of money supply, exhibited a relatively slower growth up to the end of 1995,  followed  by  a  relatively  quicker  growth  in  1996  when  these  credits  became  the  main impetus of money supply growth.\n\nThe most remarkable feature was the growing share of  net  foreign  assets  up  to December 1995 which resulted especially in 1993-1995 in the deviations of the dynamics of M2 out of the corridor laid down by monetary policy and which gave rise to the sterilisation efforts of the CNB.\n\nThe influence of net credit to the government plus the net position of the National Property  Fund  was  negligible  in  the  period  under  analysis,  and  in  some  periods  it  even dampened money supply growth. This fact is probably unique in the transforming countries of Central  and  Eastern  Europe  and  reflects  the  prudent  fiscal  stance  of  Czech  macroeconomic policy.\n\nA  more  detailed  answer  to  the  causes  of  changes  in  the  degree  of  impact  of individual factors  on  money supply growth can be found when studying their development in different periods of the transformation.\n\nIn  Czechoslovakia,  during  the  first  transformation  years  (1990-1992)  money supply  growth  was  based  primarily  on  the  relatively  quickly  increasing  volume  of  credits granted to enterprises due to growing credit demand, which was very closely connected with the\n\nliberalisation of entrepreneurial activities in a newly created market environment (an increasing number of businesses in need of initial capital).\n\nGradually, foreign money creation also expanded, affected by the development of an improving balance of payments, particularly the current account.\n\nThe  gradual stabilisation of the  macroeconomic  and  political  environment (apparent mainly after the dissolution of the Czechoslovak Federation in January, 1993, and the relatively rapid calming of price developments following the introduction of a new tax system based on value added tax), the commencement of the activities of capital market institutions and the stability of the exchange rate which significantly decreased the risks for foreign investors, led in the second half of 1993 to a significant strengthening of the influence of the inflow of foreign funds into the Czech Republic on money supply growth.\n\nThe strong foreign capital inflows continued to influence money supply growth in 1994 and 1995 when capital inflows reached 18 per cent of GDP. This growth was particularly generated by increasing foreign direct investments, portfolio investments and relatively cheaper foreign credits drawn by domestic enterprises.\n\nBecause the increasing inflow of foreign money  was  accompanied by a continuous demand for credits on the part of  enterprises  (financed  partially  also  from  foreign resources), this situation called for the sterilisation of excess funds, taking into account the goals of monetary policy.\n\nParadoxically, due to the government's sound fiscal policy, we were confronted with an  insufficient  amount  of  government  securities,  and  therefore  the  CNB  had  to  issue  its own bills and sold them to commercial banks to weaken the impact on the volume of money stock.\n\nA certain  turnaround  has  occurred  since  the  end  of  1995.  Contrary  to  previous years, the foreign sector helped to weaken money supply growth due to an increasing balance of trade deficit and the slower growth of foreign capital inflows into the country.\n\n## Exchange rate policy\n\nThe above-mentioned development of the composition of the monetary aggregates has influenced attitudes vis-à-vis exchange rate policy.\n\nAt the beginning of the transformation we were faced with the difficult choice of setting an appropriate exchange rate.\n\nOn  the  eve  of  the  programme  of  price  and  trade  liberalisation  the  government took the decision to use the exchange rate as a nominal anchor because in a small, open economy the domestic price level is heavily affected by the exchange rate.\n\nHaving taken into account various considerations in December 1990, we fixed the new exchange rate at 28 Czechoslovak crowns per US dollar, which then was about the middle ground between the parallel black market rate and the calculated cost of earning one dollar of foreign exchange.\n\nSince then the Czech crown has been pegged firstly to a basket of the currencies of five major trading partners and since 1993, with a view to the development of the currency breakdown of foreign payments, to a two-currency basket (65 per cent Deutsche Mark and 35 per cent US dollar).\n\nThe improvement in macroeconomic stability and relatively high foreign exchange  reserves  created  good  starting  conditions  for  the  gradual  extension  of  the  Czech crown's convertibility.\n\nSome  additional  measures  were  taken  in  1994  by  means  of  an  amendment  in August 1994 to the Foreign Exchange Act. This amendment made it possible to export securities denominated  in  Czech  currency;  foreign  exchange  permits  for  direct  investment  outside  the Czech Republic were  provided  to  virtually  all  applicants  and  permit  procedures  for  obtaining foreign exchange credits from abroad and for equity participation abroad were simplified.\n\nEffective October 1, 1995 the Czech currency became convertible in accordance with Article VIII of the IMF Articles of Agreement, and the country became a member of the OECD. Under the new Foreign Exchange Act the current account of the balance of payments was  liberalised  and  the  regulation  of  the  capital  account  was  substantially  reduced.  Only  the establishment of accounts abroad by residents, the outright purchase of securities by residents, the  provision  of  financial  credits  to  non-residents  and  real  estate  purchases  by  non-residents continue to be subject to regulation.\n\nTextbook analysis (the Mundell-Fleming model for an open economy) demonstrates  that  a  nation  under  a  fixed  nominal  exchange  rate  system  cannot  pursue  an independent monetary policy. Developments in the Czech Republic in 1993-1995 confirms this statement. The rapid increase in net foreign assets mentioned above had to be dampened by a smaller increase of domestic credits and in February 1996 gave rise to an important decision of the CNB's Board.\n\nThe Bank's Board widened the band for the fluctuations of the crown's exchange rate from 0.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent, including the maintenance of a 0.25 per cent spread, i.e. the  difference  between  the  buying  and  selling  rate  used  in  transactions  between  the  CNB  and commercial banks at the foreign exchange fixing.\n\nThe CNB is prepared to intervene only in such a way that the exchange rate does not deviate from the announced fluctuation band. In January 1997 we witnessed an interesting and  rather  suprising  development.  In  spite  of  the  factors  working  in  the  medium  run  in  the direction of depreciation (the higher inflation rate in the Czech Republic than in the countries of our major trading partners and the increasing trade deficit) the exchange rate as hovering around 4  per  cent  in  the  revaluation  band!  The  explanation  is  given  by  the  theory  of  asset  demand  there is still a high demand for Czech crowns by foreign entities.\n\n## Inflation and monetary policy\n\nInstead  of  using  money  supply  target  as  an  intermediary  target,  some  countries (New  Zealand,  the  United  Kingdom  and  others)  aim  directly  at  inflation  goals  because  no sufficiently reliable relation exists between any conceivable intermediate target and inflation.\n\nThis practice has not been adopted in the Czech Republic because in transforming economies the link between the money supply and the price level has some specific features.\n\nEverybody  agrees  with  Friedman  that  inflation  is  always  and  everywhere  a monetary phenomenon. It means that over the longer term, a general rise in prices is not possible without an undue expansion of the money stock.\n\nOne  of  my  predecessors  in  this  series  of  lectures,  the  former  President  of  the Swiss  National  Bank,  Dr.  Markus  Lusser,  declared  in  his  memorial  lecture  in  1994  that  in Switzerland  the  time  lapse  between  the  introduction  of  monetary  policy  measures  and  their impact on prices is two to three years.\n\nBIS Review   25/1997",

         "## Bank of France reports industrial output continued to grow in most sectors in France in January 1997 BANK OF FRANCE, MONTHLY BUSINESS SURVEY, 17/2/97.\n\nIn  January,  according  to  the  business  leaders  surveyed  by  the  Banque  de  France, industrial  output continued  to  grow  in  most  sectors.    Activity  was  especially  buoyant  in  the intermediate goods and consumer goods sectors.  The food processing sector was alone in recording a contraction in activity.\n\nThe capacity utilization rate improved.\n\nOverall  demand strengthened  further.    French  products  were  very  competitive  on foreign markets and this led to an increase in export orders.  Export sales increased in the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany, while demand remained firm in the United States and Asia.  On the domestic market, inter-industry demand was strong, even though the orders received came with very short delivery times in most cases.\n\nOrder books are now near to normal levels.  They are still considered to be low in the food-processing and automobile industries, but are deemed to be satisfactory in the capital goods and consumer goods sectors. Inventories of finished products are gradually returning to normal overall, but  they  still  exceed  the  desired  levels  in  the  consumer  goods,  food-processing  and  intermediate goods sectors.\n\nThe outlook for the coming months is distinctly brighter.  Activity should increase in all sectors, with marked improvements in the intermediate goods and food-processing sectors.\n\nCommodity  prices  were  stable  overall,  while finished  product  prices declined slightly.    This  fall  stemmed  mainly  from  substantial  price  cuts  in  the  automobile  industry,  while prices generally held up in the other sectors.\n\nInvestment plans for 1997 appear to be less ambitious on the whole compared with capital  spending  plans  at  the  same  period  in  1996.    Nevertheless,  the  business  leaders  polled  in January were more confident about future activity than they were a few months earlier.  This could mean  that  previously  postponed  investment  plans  may  be  implemented  in  the  coming  months. However, plans for  increasing  output  capacity  remained  few  and  far  between,  owing  to  the  spare capacity currently available, and depend on stronger growth in demand.\n\nRetail  sales in  January  were  up  markedly  over  December  1996,  and  only  slightly down on the exceptionally high level recorded a year earlier.\n\nEmployment levels remained  stable  in  nearly  all  industrial  sectors.    They  showed only  a  slight  change  in  the  services  and  retail  sectors,  but  there  were  further  falls  in  the  building industry.\n\nBIS Review   23/1997",

         "Statement by the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, Mr. Maurice O'Connell, to the Joint Committee of the Oireachtas (Parliament) on Finance and the Public Service in Dublin on 18/2/97.",
         "Mr. O'Connell reports on the Irish economy and different aspects of the Central Bank of Ireland's activities Statement by the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, Mr. Maurice O'Connell, to the Joint Committee of the Oireachtas (Parliament) on Finance and the Public Service in Dublin on 18/2/97.\n\nI  thank you for your invitation and I welcome the opportunity to appear before this Committee.\n\nInternationally, the economic outlook remains generally good. While the crisis in Asia has reduced forecasts, there is still optimism that reasonable growth with low inflation will continue. Worldwide, there is a strong consensus on the merits of price stability and reduced budget deficits as the best platform for growth and employment.\n\nIn Europe, the picture is mixed. In general, there has been some improvement in the past half year and a growth rate not far off 3 per cent on average is predicted for 1998. The prospects for substantial reductions in unemployment in the short term remain disappointing. Unemployment in Europe is seen largely as a structural problem that can only be resolved over an extended period. On the positive side inflation has been subdued and interest rates are relatively low. As we move towards the deadline for decision on membership of EMU, there is a great awareness everywhere, in shaping policy, of the requirements to satisfy the entry conditions.\n\n## The Irish economy\n\nIreland's position is unique at the moment by European standards. Economic growth has continued to exceed expectations. The Central Bank expects that growth this year will be of the order of 7 to 8 per cent. Others might put the figure higher. While growth will probably slow down in the years ahead, it should remain well above the European average. The Central Bank estimates that a long-term  growth  pattern  of  the  order  of  4-5  per  cent  is  within  our  capability,  if  the  international environment  remains  benign.  This  will  depend  on  a  number  of  factors,  not  least  continuing  low inflation. The current national wage arrangements provide a solid basis for cost competitiveness and it is most important that these terms are not diluted. Unemployment is below the European average. The progress on job creation in recent years is impressive and the outlook is good.\n\nIn its quarterly report published in December the Central Bank forecasted an average inflation rate for this year of 2½ per cent, which is relatively low in absolute terms and is within the threshold  for  qualification  for  EMU.  The  subsequent  decline  in  the  Irish  pound  has  increased  the prospect  of  a  somewhat  higher  figure.  There  are  other  factors  such  as  asset  price  increases  and tightening  conditions  in  the  labour  market,  which  also  carry  the  potential  for  overheating  of  the economy and higher inflation. These are a source of concern because they could ultimately damage the economy.\n\nOne feature of the strong performance of the economy is the growth in private sector credit. The cumulative growth in the past three years was over 50 per cent and it is now increasing at an  annual  rate  above  20  per  cent.  As  we  started  from  a  level  of  indebtedness  relatively  low  by international standards, growth on this scale may not be a cause of immediate alarm. On all previous experience, however, it would be unsustainable in the longer term without inflationary consequences. The ready availability of credit at relatively low interest rate levels has been a contributory factor to the excessive rises last year in house prices which are now at historically high levels in real terms and by reference to average earnings. House prices have risen by 40-50 per cent since 1994. There are\n\npredictions  that  a  further  substantial  rise  in  prices  this  year  is  likely.  We  may  not  be  far  from  a situation where home ownership will be beyond the reach of persons on average incomes.\n\nThere  seems  to  be  a  perception  that  the  Central  Bank  can  exercise  some  legal authority in restricting  credit.  It  has  no  such  authority.  Any  restriction  would  be  inconsistent  with European Union practice. Besides, it would be  unworkable  as  demand  would  probably  be  met  by overseas lenders. The introduction of the single currency will facilitate access by overseas lenders. The Bank continues to monitor the conditions applied by the credit institutions in lending for house purchase. It has warned these institutions repeatedly of the dangers inherent in high rates of credit growth  and  any  relaxation  of  lending  standards.  Insofar  as  the  Bank  can  establish,  100  per  cent mortgages  have  been  issued  only  in  exceptional  cases  where  properties  were  being  purchased  for investment.  The  Bank  would  not  encourage  this  practice  and  the  credit  institutions  have  been  so advised.\n\n## Economic and monetary union\n\nPreparation for EMU is a dominant feature of the  work  of  the  Central  Bank  at  the moment. Our duty is to ensure, as best we can, that Ireland continues to fulfil the entry requirements, in particular the requirement on inflation, and that the banking and financial system in general is well prepared for the single currency.\n\nIt now seems virtually assured that EMU will start on schedule on 1st January 1999 and that a substantial majority of European Union countries will participate from the outset. Control of monetary policy will pass immediately to the Governing Council of the European Central Bank and decisions  will  be  made  on  the  basis  of  European  requirements.  We  will  no  longer  be  able  to adjust the exchange rate or interest rates to correct domestic problems. The priority of the European Central  Bank  will  be  price  stability.  Besides,  the  conditions  of  the  Stability  and  Growth  Pact effectively require that member countries run a balanced budget over a complete economic cycle.\n\nThe preparations for monetary union at operational level are well advanced, under the aegis of the European Monetary Institute. Much of this work is of a detailed technical nature relating to business between the individual central banks. The EMI has recommended two possible monetary policy strategies for the European Central Bank - monetary targeting and direct inflation targeting. Among  the  other  important  strategic  issues  are  the  extent  of  decentralisation,  management  of reserves, pooling of reserves and monetary income and linking of payment systems. There are some awkward issues yet to be resolved. The definition of monetary income for instance is a problem.\n\nIn the single currency regime there will be a deliberate policy of decentralisation and the  day-to-day  activities  of  the  Central  Bank  will  be  conducted  within  this  framework.  We  will continue  to  manage  reserves  and  to  provide  liquidity  to  the  banks.  We  will,  however,  work  to guidelines or benchmarks determined by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank. In certain  areas  of  the  Bank  the  working  day  will  be  extended.  Our  preliminary  arrangements  for production and stockpiling of euro banknotes and coin are well under way. While the deadline of 1st January 2002 may seem distant, we must begin production far in advance.\n\nThere have been reports to the effect that the Central Bank will have a large surplus of reserves when we join EMU. This is misleading. At the end of 1997 the Bank had total assets of £6½ billion.  These assets were matched by corresponding liabilities of £5 billion, leaving net assets, or internal reserves, of nearly £1½ billion. The Bank will continue to need internal reserves. I would not speculate on an appropriate level. We may not need the present level of reserves in due course but it\n\nis too early to make a judgement on this until we have experience of the new system. All of the other national central banks participating in EMU will be in a similar position. Our internal reserves as a proportion  of  total  assets  are  about  average  by  European  Union  standards.  I  might  add  that  any transfer of internal reserves would reduce future earnings and profit transfers to the Exchequer.\n\nFrom 1st January next onwards, all Central Bank business will be conducted in the new  currency,  the  euro.  All  accounts  with  the  Bank,  whether  held  by  credit  institutions,  the Government  or  international  institutions,  will  be  in  euro.  Existing  notes  and  coin  will  become constituent  parts  of  the  euro.  The  banks  generally  must  be  ready  to  make  any  banking  service required in Ireland available in euro. From January next, they will process lodgements and payments in Irish pounds or euro, as required. It would be reasonable to anticipate that Irish business in general will move to the euro faster than the official timetable requires.\n\nThe  National  Changeover  Plan,  published  some  weeks  ago,  draws  attention  to arrangements for the period of transition pending the introduction of euro banknotes and coin. During this period banknotes of the member States participating in EMU must be exchanged at par value. From January the Central Bank will provide an inward exchange service free of charge.\n\n## Exchange rate/interest rate\n\nI am under the usual constraints in regard to comment on current exchange rates and interest rates for the Irish pound. These issues are highly sensitive. Determination of exchange rate policy is the prerogative of the Minister for Finance. It has been decided that the method for arriving at  the  conversion  rates  for  the  different  currencies,  including  the  Irish  pound,  will  be  settled  and announced at the time of decision on EMU membership. This decision, it now appears, will be taken on 3rd May. Nothing further has been decided at this stage in relation to fixing of exchange rates.\n\nThe intention to pre-announce bilateral rates in May is driven by the general concern throughout  Europe  to  avoid  market  speculation  as  we  move  closer  to  the  January  1999  deadline. While national authorities will continue to be responsible for the exchange rate  of  their  respective currencies  up  to  this  deadline,  the  May  agreement  should  have  a  decisive  influence  and  should diminish the possibility of considerable fluctuations.\n\nThere has been substantial convergence of interest rates in Europe in recent months. Irish interest rates, at the short end of the scale, though low by historic standards, remain substantially above  levels  across  much  of  Europe.  There  has  been  a  good  reason  for  this.  It  reflects  domestic conditions  here  as  the  economy  has  continued  to  be  exceptionally  buoyant  and  the  threat  of overheating remains. If we were not on the doorstep of EMU, our interest rates would now be higher. Wholesale interest rates must converge, among the countries participating in EMU, by January 1999. This  points  to  the  expectation  of  reductions  in  Irish  rates,  even  if  European  rates  were  to  move upwards further in the meantime. I cannot quantify reductions precisely nor can I outline a timepath. It is evident, however, that some reductions of significance are likely. In the meantime, Irish interest rate policy will be influenced by the requirements of the domestic economy. The Central Bank will retain the discretion to adjust rates for as long as possible.\n\nI  might  also  draw  the  attention  of  members  to  the  impact  on  savings.  In  a  lower interest rate regime some deposit rates must inevitably come down. The returns on call deposits in particular are already at very low levels. It would be unwise to assume that interest rates will remain permanently low once the euro area is established. As with the US dollar, successful management of the euro will require periodic interest rate adjustments to secure the objective of price stability.\n\nIn the context of EMU, the relationship with sterling is of obvious concern to us. We now know that the UK will not join EMU for some time ahead. It would be better for us, if it joined at the outset. I cannot predict future movements of sterling relative to the euro. I would, however, point to the Treaty requirements that all member States should treat exchange rate policy as a matter of common interest. This applies as much to the UK as to anybody else. The Bank of England will participate in the General Council of the European System of Central Banks and will be subject to the obligations that this imposes. I would further suggest that the decision last year to give operational independence to the Bank of England is significant in this context. It is working to an inflation target and this arrangement should reduce the likelihood of large-scale fluctuations of sterling vis-à-vis the euro.\n\nIt  is  vitally  important  that  the  credibility  of  the  euro  is  established  immediately.  To achieve  this  the  new  currency  must  be  supported  by  a  solid  economic  background  and  political consensus. There is considerable speculation about the merits of a hard or a soft currency. The critical factor is that the currency be stable in terms of European prices so that its international role will be secure and that, in time, it will challenge the dominance of the US dollar. The external value of the euro will be largely determined by the monetary policy implemented by the European Central Bank and by developments in the foreign exchange markets for the major industrial currencies.\n\n## Supervision\n\nMay I now turn to a different aspect of our activities.\n\nThe Central Bank's approach to supervision reflects European legal requirements and is in line with best international practice. The basic objectives of supervision of banks and building societies  are  to  protect  depositors  and  investors  and  to  ensure  as  far  as  possible  that  risks  to  the financial  system  as  a  whole  are  minimised.  Insofar  as  the  Bank  examines  individual  customer accounts, its focus is always on the solvency of the institution. Our main attention is focused on the quality of loans and other assets and good management. We frequently come across breaches of the rules. Many of these would be of a minor nature. Most are dealt with by administrative action. We discourage  applications  for  banking  licences  unless  we  are  fully  satisfied  as  to  the  status  of  the applicant.\n\nNo system of supervision, however comprehensive, can give a one hundred per cent guarantee against abuse. Effective  supervision  requires  the  co-operation  of  the  entity  that  is  being supervised.  Despite  the  improvements  in  controls,  and  international  co-operation,  bank  failures continue. The ultimate objective worldwide is to avoid systemic problems.\n\nArising from the Tribunals of Inquiry and other recent developments, there has been some confusion about the confidentiality exercised by the Central Bank in relation to its functions. May  I  say  at  the  outset  that  we  are  co-operating  to  the  fullest  extent  possible  with  Tribunal investigations.\n\nMembers are aware that the  Central  Bank  is  conducting  an  investigation  following recent allegations against National Irish Bank. I am precluded from discussing individual cases.\n\nThe Bank is bound under law,  to  observe  strict  rules  of  confidentiality.  It  may  not disclose information about individual entities or persons to any third parties, other than in exceptional circumstances. These include criminal proceedings in court, providing information to the Gardai on money laundering and other criminal activity, including tax evasion, and transfer of information to\n\nother regulatory authorities. The Bank is prohibited from communicating information to the Revenue Commissioners.  We  are  not  tax  investigators.  It  is  the  duty  of  individual  financial  institutions  to report  to  the  Gardai  suspicions  of  criminal  activity  (including  tax  evasion)  by  their  customers.  I understand that such reports to the Gardai are not infrequent. If we become aware of tax abuse, by an institution that we supervise, it is our duty to notify the Gardai.\n\nThese requirements derive from and are consistent with European Union laws. Other banking supervisors in the European Union are subject to similar confidentiality requirements. Our situation is in no sense unique. If the Irish authorities attempted to abandon these requirements, not only would we be in breach of EU law but we would forfeit the co-operation of other supervisors in exchanging  information.  This  exchange  of  information  is  vital.  Without  it,  we  simply  could  not operate as a competent supervisory authority and operations by Irish banks abroad would be called into question.\n\nThe supervisory duties of the Central Bank have been extended considerably in recent years. The International Financial Services Centre continues to expand. Last year responsibility for all  investment intermediaries was assigned to the Bank. In response, we have contacted more than one thousand intermediaries in order to compile a  register  and  to  develop  a  code  of  conduct.  The supervision of small retail operations is a new departure for the Bank and it may take some time yet to settle on a definite pattern of operation. A further complication is that a majority of intermediaries are  also  engaged  in  insurance  and  other  activities  which  are  not  the  responsibility  of  the  Central Bank. It makes little sense to examine investment operations without taking some overview of the total business of an intermediary.\n\nExchange controls have also been in the news. In operating these controls up to their abolition in 1992, the Central Bank acted as agent for the Minister for Finance. The Bank may give information on these matters to the Minister only.\n\n## Irish financial institutions\n\nIrish banks and financial institutions generally have been returning consistently strong profits.  This  is  unsurprising  in  view  of  the  favourable  conditions  for  lending  and  minimising  bad debts. At the same time, operating margins have been reducing significantly in the face of sharper competition. All indications suggest that competition will intensify further in the years ahead. There will be expensive technological developments and competition from outside will be facilitated by the single currency in EMU.  It  would  be  reasonable  to  predict that there may  be  significant rationalisation  within  our  financial  system  in  the  period  ahead.  It  would  be  disappointing  if  this resulted  in  a  situation  where  the  great  proportion  of  Irish  banking  was  controlled  from  outside.  I should also mention the impressive overseas expansion by a number of Irish financial institutions in recent years.\n\nWe live in a world of large-scale movement of funds across borders and Ireland is no exception. Given the open nature of the Irish economy, it is no surprise that cross-border holdings of funds in our case are relatively high.\n\nThe total volume of deposits, excluding interbank deposits, with banks and building societies in Ireland is estimated to be in the region of £60 billion. Roughly one third of these deposits are  held  by  non-resident  companies and individuals. This proportion is quite  high  by  international standards.  On  the  other  hand  deposits  held  abroad  by  Irish  residents  -  again  excluding  interbank figures - are in the region of £11 billion. This figure is high by international comparison. The figure\n\nhas quadrupled in the past ten years, reflecting the growth in Irish trade, the removal of exchange controls  in  the  context  of  the  single  European  market  and  the  development  of  the  International Financial Services Centre.\n\nThis covers only the deposit side of the picture. Borrowing by Irish  residents  from overseas banks has also grown rapidly in the past decade. It is now estimated to be of a similar order of magnitude to overseas deposits. Access to credit abroad at competitive interest rates, growth in the multinational sector and the IFSC have contributed to this development.\n\nThis  is  by  no  means  a  comprehensive  picture.  It  does  not  incorporate  cross-border flows  in  securities  and  other  investments  such  as  equities,  for  which  we  do  not  have  specific information. The Central Bank is aware throughout every day of the broad quantities of funds moving in and out of Irish pounds across the foreign exchange market. It does not have knowledge of the movement of funds on behalf of individual bank customers.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nBefore I conclude, may I refer again briefly to monetary policy. In the implementation of monetary policy the first objective of the Central Bank at all times is price stability. This will also be  the  first  objective  of  the  European  Central  Bank  and  this  is  made  abundantly  clear  in  the Maastricht Treaty. Price stability is the best foundation for a growing economy and for continuing improvements in employment. This has been demonstrated consistently, not just in the Irish situation but worldwide.\n\nBIS Review   16/1998",

         "Bank of Japan's February review of monetary and economic trends in Japan  (Central Bank Articles and Speeches, 18 Feb 97)",
         "BANK OF JAPAN, MONTHLY ECONOMIC REVIEW, 18/2/97.",
         "## Bank of Japan's February review of monetary and economic trends in Japan BANK OF JAPAN, MONTHLY ECONOMIC REVIEW, 18/2/97.\n\nA  moderate  economic  recovery  continues  in  Japan  as  private  demand  shows increasing firmness.  With respect to final demand, public-sector investment has decreased while net  exports  are  on  an  increasing  trend.    Housing  investment  has  remained  at  a  high  level  and business  fixed  investment  is  increasing  steadily.    While  growth  in  personal  consumption  has been moderate on the whole, passenger car sales, which have a strong influence on production, have accelerated significantly.  Meanwhile, inventories on the whole are at appropriate levels. In these circumstances, industrial production has recently increased at a somewhat fast pace and labor market conditions have continued to improve moderately.  Meanwhile, prices have stopped declining, and monetary aggregates continue to grow at 3.0 - 4.0 per cent.\n\nWith regard to personal consumption, sales at department stores and supermarkets are improving moderately, albeit with some fluctuations.  Outlays for travel have remained firm. Growth  in  sales  of  electrical  appliances  has  become  somewhat  moderate  as  the  pace  of expansion in personal computers and cellular telephones decelerated.  Passenger car sales have recorded  buoyant  two-digit  growth  year-to-year  for  four  consecutive  months  since  October 1996.\n\nAmong  leading  indicators  of  business  fixed  investment,  machinery  orders  are increasing steadily on average, although they are expected to show a decline in the first quarter of  1997  as  a  reaction  to  the  large  increase  recorded  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  1996  in  both  the manufacturing  and  non-manufacturing  sectors.    Construction  floor  area  has  also  continued  to pick up moderately.\n\nWith respect to housing investment, housing starts have remained strong reflecting low interest rates and reasonable housing prices. They recorded a high seasonally-adjusted annual rate of over 1.7 million starts in the fourth quarter  of  1996,  partly reflecting the rise in orders ahead of the consumption tax rate hike.\n\nRegarding public-sector investment, public works contracted showing developments in orders have decreased significantly since autumn 1996 compared to the  high level recorded in the previous year which reflected the large economic stimulus package.  As for actual implementation of public works, with a time lag after orders, the seasonally adjusted level of  shipments  of  related  goods  has  been  decreasing  since  autumn  1996  after  having  increased until the summer.\n\nReal exports have recently shown an increasing trend as the effects of the yen's depreciation  since  summer  1995  have  gradually  permeated.    Meanwhile,  the  increase  in  real imports has slowed, also reflecting the depreciation of the yen.  As a result, the real trade surplus turned to an increase in autumn 1996.  The nominal current account surplus is also beginning to rise, although the pace of increase is slower than that of the real trade surplus, partly because the rise in oil prices is pushing up import volume.\n\nIndustrial production has increased significantly by an annual rate of over 10 per cent quarter-to-quarter in  the  fourth  quarter  of  1996.    This  increase  was  caused  by  the  rise  in final  demand,  particularly  in  demand  conducive  to  production,  such  as  passenger  car  sales, machinery  orders,  and  net  exports,  in  addition  to  the  completion  of  inventory  adjustments. Industrial  production  is  expected  to  continue  increasing  significantly  in  January  and  February 1997, reflecting the rise in demand ahead of the consumption tax rate hike.\n\nLabor  market  conditions  have  continued  to  improve  moderately  on  the  whole. Although  the  unemployment  rate  remains  at  a  high  level  and  employment  growth  has  been moderate, overtime working hours have significantly exceeded the level of the previous year in line with production growth, and the ratio of job offers to job applications has continued its rise.\n\nWith  respect  to  price  developments,  domestic  wholesale  prices  (adjusted  for seasonal  electricity  rates)  have  stopped  declining,  although  downward  pressures  such  as  from competition  with  imports  and  technological  innovation  in,  e.g.,  electrical  machinery,  remain strong.  This development has been supported by the yen's depreciation to date, the rise in crude oil prices and the moderate improvement in domestic supply and demand conditions.  Corporate service  prices  have  declined,  particularly  in  rents  and  leasing  charges,  but  the  year-to-year decrease  has  become  smaller.    Consumer  prices  (nationwide,  excluding  perishables)  have exceeded the level of the previous year, as the decline in commodity prices has slowed against the background of the yen' depreciation and the halt in the decline in domestic wholesale prices.\n\nGrowth  in  monetary  aggregates,  measured  in  terms  of  the  year-to-year  growth rate of M2 + CDs average outstanding, has remained stable on the whole at 3.0 - 4.0 per cent. Although  lending  by  private  financial  institutions  has  been  weak,  that  by  public  financial institutions has been firm.\n\nRegarding money market rates,  the  overnight  call  rate  (uncollateralized)  on  the whole has stayed somewhat below the official discount rate of 0.5 per cent.  The 3-month CD rate has moved at 0.50 - 0.55 per cent.  Meanwhile, with regard to the market 's interest rate expectations, 3-month Euro-yen futures are showing relatively minor movements after declining at  a  brisk  pace  between  summer  and  autumn  1996.    In  these  circumstances,  the  long-term government  bond  yield  had  been  declining  since  summer  1996,  and  has  recently  moved  at around 2.4 per cent.\n\nWith  respect  to  bank  lending  rates,  the  short-term  prime  lending  rate  has remained at a record low level of 1.625 per cent since September 1995.  The long-term prime lending rate was lowered three times by a total of 0.8 percentage points since September 1996 in response to the developments in the long-term interest rates, and has been moving at the record low of 2.5 per cent since December.  In these circumstances, short-term and long-term average contracted interest rates on new loans and discounts have moved at around record low levels.\n\nOn the stock exchange, the Nikkei 225 stock average plummeted between the end of  1996  and  early  1997  reflecting  market's  uncertainties  about  Japan's  economic  outlook  and balance-sheet problems.  It became stable in late January 1997 and has recently stayed around ¥18,000 - 19,000.\n\nIn  the  foreign  exchange  market,  the  yen  depreciated  moderately  on  the  whole against  the  U.S.  dollar  in  1996,  but  the  pace  of  depreciation  has  accelerated  since  the  end  of 1996.  The yen has recently moved at around ¥123 - 124 to the U.S. dollar.  Meanwhile, the yen has been relatively stable against the deutsche mark at around ¥73 - 74.",

         "Dr.  Stals  looks  at  the  options  and  strategies  for  monetary  policy  in  South Africa Address  by  the  Governor  of  the  South  African  Reserve  Bank,  Dr.  C.S.  Stals,  at  the Twentieth  Annual  Investment  Conference  of  Société  Générale  Frankel  Pollak  (Pty)  Ltd.  in Johannesburg on 18/2/97.\n\n## 1. A sharp decline in the net capital inflow from abroad set the financial scene for 1996\n\nThe most important change in the financial situation in South Africa last year was the sudden decline in the net inflow of capital from abroad that occurred in the first quarter. A number  of  adverse  developments  at  the  time  combined  to  trigger  an  outflow  of  short-term capital.  Coming  after  three  years  of  rather  strong  rises  in  total  domestic  expenditure  and  a growing deficit in the current account of the balance of payments, the deterioration in the capital account led to an overall  balance  of  payments  deficit  that  created  immediate  shortages  in  the market for foreign exchange.\n\nAfter a record net capital inflow of more than R6 billion occurred in the fourth quarter of 1995, to bring the total net inflow for the year close to R20 billion, there was a small net outflow in the first quarter of 1996. The current account deficit was no longer covered by a net capital inflow and the exchange rate of the rand came under immediate pressure. With a low level  of  official  foreign  reserves,  a  growing  deficit  in  the  current  account  of  the  balance  of payments  and  deteriorating  prospects  for  a  renewed  inflow  of  capital  into  the  country, participants  in  the  market  for  foreign  exchange  became  very  nervous  and  reacted  wildly  to rumours, adverse political developments and negative news about the balance of payments, the foreign reserves, and domestic economic developments.\n\nThe initial depreciation of the rand created negative expectations which became self-fulfilling, particularly as leads and  lags  in  short-term  trade  financing  also  moved  strongly against  South  Africa,  and  South  Africans  became  more  reluctant  to  enter  into  new  foreign currency denominated commitments.\n\nThe  exchange  rate  of  the  rand,  which  in  nominal  terms  showed  an  effective appreciation of 4.4 per cent from May 1995 up to the end of December 1995, then depreciated by 8 per cent in the first quarter of 1996, by 7.2 per cent in the second quarter, and by a further 9.5 per cent in the four months up to the end of October 1996. Over the first ten months of 1996, the effective depreciation of the rand in nominal terms exceeded 22 per cent. In real terms, this represented a depreciation of about 15 per cent.\n\nAn ex post analysis of the composition of the capital in- and outflows of last year provides  interesting  information  for  a  better  understanding  of  the  changes  that  took  place. Initially,  it  was  mainly  a  sudden  reversal  in  the  inflow  of  short-term  capital  in  the  form  of inter-bank and trade related financing arrangements that triggered the shortages in the market for foreign exchange. As the exchange rate depreciated and South African residents became more concerned  about  possible  losses  on  foreign  currency  exposures,  long-term  foreign  loans  were repaid  without  replacement  or  extensions.  South  Africans  with  existing  short-  and  long-term foreign currency commitments covered their positions forward, and the Reserve Bank's forward exchange book showed a sharp increase of the net oversold position. In the fourth quarter of last year, when short-term capital began to flow back again, there was a net outflow from the private sector  of  R6  billion  in  the  form  of  longer-term  capital,  mostly  for  the  repayment  of  maturing loans.\n\nAnother  interesting  feature  of  the  international  capital  flows  last  year  was  that foreigners remained important net portfolio investors in South African securities. Non-residents increased their holdings of South African equities listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange by R5.3 billion, and added a net amount of R3.4 billion to their holdings of South African bonds acquired  through  the  South  African  bond  market.  This  ostensibly  'volatile'  element  of  the capital flows was therefore not responsible for the problems that developed in the South African balance of payments last year.\n\n## 2.  Monetary  policy  faced  with  new  challenges  in  a  situation  of  a  deteriorating  balance  of payments\n\nThe abrupt decline in the capital inflows from abroad in the first quarter of 1996 confronted the monetary policy authorities with an unexpected new challenge. Since 1994, the Reserve Bank's policy on international financial relations was to rebuild the country's depleted official foreign reserves gradually, to relax the exchange controls on a step-by-step basis, and to restructure  the  market  in  foreign  exchange  gradually  with  the  objective  of  enabling  a  more efficient market to determine not only the spot foreign exchange rate of the rand, but also the forward rate.\n\nGood progress was made on this road during 1994 and 1995, but the country was surely not yet in a position to withstand the adverse developments of early 1996, or to protect the  exchange  rate  of  the  rand  against  a  series  of  determined  attacks  in  a  rather  vulnerable situation. The Reserve Bank realised that it was not in a position to defend the exchange rate of the rand by providing large amounts of foreign exchange from the official foreign reserves. At the time of the dramatic decline in the net capital inflow in February 1996, the Reserve Bank held  about  R15  billion  in  official  foreign  reserves,  while  the  private  banking  sector  held  an additional amount of about R4 billion in liquid foreign assets. The total of R19 billion was the equivalent  of  about  8  weeks'  imports.  Taking  account  of  the  growing  deficit  in  the  current account  of  the  balance  of  payments,  the  Bank  could  only  make  limited  amounts  of  foreign exchange  available  to  ensure  that  no  serious  shortage  of  liquidity  would  develop  that  could create a panic on its own.\n\nThe  longer-term  objectives  of  building  up  the  foreign  reserves  to  a  more comfortable  level,  of  reducing  the  role  of  the  Reserve  Bank  in  the  forward  foreign  exchange market, and of phasing out the remaining foreign exchange controls were temporarily forced on the  backburner,  whilst  monetary  policy  had  to  be  directed  more  decisively  towards  an adjustment programme that would gradually restore stability in the market for foreign exchange. 3. The monetary policy adjustment programme\n\nThree basic deficiencies in the underlying economic fundamentals were identified at the time that contributed to the lack of confidence in the South African economy, and in the ability of the South African authorities to restore stability in the market for foreign exchange.\n\nFirstly, the growing deficit in the current account of the balance of payments had to  be  reversed,  particularly  after  it  became  evident  that  the  country  could  not  rely  on  a permanent  and  sustainable  large  capital  inflow  from  the  rest  of  the  world  to  cover  an  everincreasing current deficit.\n\nSecondly,  the  imminent  danger  of  escalating  inflation,  particularly  after  some depreciation in the exchange rate of the rand, had to be avoided. There was a real and perceived\n\ndanger  that  South  Africa  was  destined  for  a  new  vicious  circle  of  depreciation-inflationdepreciation  that  would  unavoidably  lead  to  a  further  erosion  of  the  country's  competitive position in the world markets.\n\nThirdly, the escalating growth rates in the domestic monetary aggregates, such as the  money supply and bank credit extension, had to be reversed.  By  accommodating  the  new inflationary  pressures  emanating  from  the  depreciation  of  the  rand  on  a  continuous  basis, monetary policy would obviously aggravate the situation.\n\nWith  only  limited  means  at  its  disposal  to  finance  the  external  deficit,  South Africa had no alternative but to adjust the disequilibrium, mainly by reducing or eliminating the current  account  deficit.  To  achieve  this  objective,  the  following  monetary  policy  strategy  was followed:\n\nNot  being  in  a  position  to  fix  the  exchange  rate  at  any  predetermined  level,  a depreciation of the rand was unavoidable and had to be accepted as part of the solution to the problem. The Bank sold some foreign exchange from its official reserves, not with the intention to  fix  the  exchange  rate,  but  rather  to  provide  liquidity  to  the  market  and  to  smooth  the adjustment process.  As the Reserve Bank sold foreign exchange to the market to partly finance the overall balance of payments deficit, domestic rand liquidity was drained from the banking system. It was imperative for the effective working of the adjustment process that the Reserve Bank would not replace  the  lost  liquidity  through,  for  example,  purchases  of  financial  assets from  the  banks  through  more  active  open-market  operations.    The  decline  in  the  domestic liquidity had to be reflected in the level of interest rates.  Higher  interest  rates  would  not  only serve to discourage the outflow of capital, but would also reduce the domestic demand for bank credit. The market trend for interest rates to rise could not be resisted.\n\nMonetary  policy  was  therefore  directed  towards  a  reinforcement  of  and  active support for a market adjustment process that would eventually restore equilibrium to the balance of payments. It was well understood that this process would not be painless, that the depreciation of the currency, the drainage of liquidity and the rising interest rates would all demand costs and sacrifices that would not be popular, and that the monetary authorities would be blamed by some ill-disposed  observers  for  the  dilemma.  Any  country  that  had  established  a  good  economic performance in one year on the basis of net capital inflow of R20 billion, and is then in the next year forced to perform on a net inflow of only R4 billion, is bound to go through some painful adjustment. South Africa was no exception.\n\n## 4. The success of the monetary adjustment programme\n\nImportant changes took place towards the end of last year, and particularly after October, in the underlying economic conditions that contributed to the financial disturbances of the preceding nine months.\n\nThere  was  a  marked  slow-down  in  the  rate  of  increase  in  real  gross  domestic expenditure. Official national accounts statistics for the fourth quarter are not yet available, but preliminary  indications  are  that  all  the  major  components  of  gross  domestic  expenditure increased at  lower  rates  in  the  second  half  than  in  the  first  half  of  last  year.  Total  real  gross domestic expenditure indeed declined somewhat from the first half to bring the rate of increase for the year more or less in line with the established growth rate of about 3 per cent in gross domestic product.  The deficit in the current account of the balance of payments progressively\n\ndeclined  from  a  seasonally  adjusted  annualised  peak  of  R13  billion  in  the  second  quarter  to about  R9  billion  in  the  third,  and  R5  billion  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year.    The  rates  of increase in both bank credit extension to the private sector and in the money supply peaked in October 1996, before declining marginally in both November and December. The quarter-to-quarter  growth  in  credit  extension  to  the  private  sector  (at  seasonally  adjusted  and annualised rates), decelerated from 22.4 per cent in the second quarter of 1996 to 16.6 per cent in the third quarter, and 11.8 per cent in the fourth quarter. In the case of the M3 money supply, the deceleration was from 21.2 per cent in the second, to 18.6 per cent in the third, and a mere 7.6  per  cent  in  the  fourth  quarter.  Not  only  the  current  account  of  the  balance  of  payments improved, but also the capital account. In the first nine months of the year, capital inflows and outflows almost cancelled out, to leave a small net inflow of less than R1 billion for the nine months'  period.  In  the  fourth  quarter,  however,  the  net  capital  inflow  increased  again  to  an estimated  R3  billion.  This  capital  inflow  once  again  exceeded  the  unadjusted  current  account deficit with the result that the country's net foreign reserves recovered some of the losses of the first nine months of the year.  The pressure in the foreign exchange market receded slightly and the  rand  started  appreciating  in  November  last  year.  Over  the  two  months  November  and December 1996, the effective nominal exchange rate of the rand appreciated by 1 per cent, and during the first six weeks of 1997 by a further 9.2 per cent. This appreciation therefore partly neutralised the adverse effects of the sharp depreciation of last year.\n\nIt  will,  of  course,  not  only  be  premature  but  also  preposterous  to  claim  the successes achieved in this process so far for monetary policy alone. Many  other  changes  also took place in South Africa over the past year. There is now more political stability than a year ago; much progress has been made with the framing and implementation of the Government's Macroeconomic Strategy for Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR); the Minister of Finance  has  confirmed  and  showed  his  determination  to  continue  with  the  required  policy  of financial discipline that will gradually reduce the deficit in the Budget as a percentage of gross domestic product.\n\nThere  is,  however,  still  the  danger  of  escalating  inflation  that  cannot  be  swept under the carpet at this juncture. After reaching an acceptable low level of only 5.5 per cent over the twelve months up to April 1996, the rate of increase in the consumer price index escalated to 9.4  per  cent  in  December  1996.  Inflation,  however,  lags  behind  changes  in  the  monetary aggregates and is, at this stage, still stimulated by the depreciation of the rand last year, and the relatively  large  increases  in  the  money  supply  during  the  1995/96  period.  It  is  of  the  utmost importance, however, that a restrictive monetary policy shall now be retained to make sure that the rate of inflation will also gradually be tamed again.\n\n## 5. Monetary policy options for 1997\n\nIt remains the main task and priority of monetary policy in South Africa to fight against  inflation.  During  1996,  the  disturbances  in  the  foreign  exchange  market  temporarily diverted the attention from this prime objective of monetary policy. Indeed, in the longer term, greater stability in the foreign exchange market will only become sustainable once the rate of inflation has been brought more or less in line with the average rate of inflation in the economies of our major trading partners and international competitors.\n\nDespite the periodic efforts of media reporters to extort a commitment from the authorities to a certain pre-defined exchange rate for the rand, it remains our view that in the contemporary complex market for foreign exchange, it is not possible to define an equilibrium exchange  rate  a  priori,  or,  in  the  case  of  the  South  African  Reserve  Bank,  with  the  limited\n\namount  of  foreign  exchange  at  its  disposal,  to  manipulate  the  exchange  rate  of  the  rand permanently in any direction against market forces.\n\nAs far as the Bank's policy on foreign exchange is concerned, it is hoped that the more favourable conditions now experienced in the market will continue throughout 1997, and will enable us to pursue the longer-term objectives of:\n\nbuilding up the total foreign reserves to a more comfortable level;  reducing the Reserve  Bank's  role  in  the  forward  foreign  exchange  market;  and    gradually  phasing  out  the remaining exchange controls.\n\nTo  the  extent  that  these  three  objectives  provide  conflicts  within  themselves, important policy decisions will have to be taken between the Bank and the Minister of Finance on the relative importance that should be attached to each one of the objectives in an appropriate policy matrix.\n\nWith the attention now being refocused on domestic policy objectives, the rising rate  of  inflation  has  become  a  matter  of  major  concern.  In  this  situation,  the  Reserve  Bank regards it as a minimum precondition for arresting this imminent threat to financial stability that the rates of increase in bank credit extension and in the money supply will be reduced soon to more acceptable levels.\n\nWith the prospects for real growth in the economy at a rate of between 2 and 3 per  cent,  and  the  desire  to  keep  inflation  to  below  10  per  cent,  the  money  supply  should obviously not increase by more than about 10 per cent during the current calendar year. This will require  the  Reserve  Bank  to  persist  with  a  relatively  restrictive  monetary  policy  for  the  time being.",

         "Mr.  Greenspan  offers  some  considerations  as  a  guide  for  government decisions  on  regulating  the  financial  markets Remarks  by  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Governors of the US  Federal  Reserve  System,  Mr.  Alan  Greenspan,  at  the  Financial  Markets Conference of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta held in Coral Gables, Florida on 21/2/97.\n\nI  am pleased to participate once again in the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's annual Financial Markets Conference. As in previous years, the Reserve Bank has developed a conference program that is quite timely. Changes in technology have permitted the development in  recent  years  of  increasingly  diverse  financial  instruments  and  intensely  competitive  market structures. The rapid evolution of products and markets has led many to conclude that market regulatory  structures,  many  of  which  were  established  in  the  1920s  and  1930s,  have  become increasingly  outdated.  Some  see  new  products  and  markets  not  covered  by  government regulation and fear the consequences of so-called 'regulatory gaps.' Others see old government regulations  applied  to  new  instruments  and  markets  and  fear  the  unintended  consequences  of what seems unnecessary and burdensome regulation.\n\nNowhere have these tensions been more evident than in the ongoing debate over the  appropriate  government  regulation  of  derivative  contracts,  a  debate  which  has  varied  in intensity but has never fully subsided for at least  ten  years.  Recent  efforts  by  members  of  the Senate  Agriculture  Committee  to  clarify  and  rationalize  the  regulation  of  derivative  contracts under  the  Commodity  Exchange  Act  have  once  again  placed  these  contentious  issues  on  the front burner. In my remarks today I shall proffer a set of considerations that I find quite valuable as a  guide  to  decisions  about  the  need  for  government  regulation  of  financial  markets.  I  shall then  review  the  history  of  government  regulation  of  derivative  contracts  and  markets  in  the United  States  and  consider  the  current  regulatory  structure  for  those  products  and  markets  in light of these considerations.\n\n## Market Regulation\n\nI  would  argue  that  the  first  imperative  when  evaluating  market  regulation  is  to enunciate clearly the public policy objectives that government regulation would be intended to promote. What market characteristics do policymakers seek to encourage? Efficiency? Fair and open access? What phenomena do we wish to discourage or eliminate? Fraud, manipulation, or other  unfair  practices?  Systemic  instability?  Without  explicit  answers  to  these  questions, government  regulation  is  unlikely  to  be  effective.  More  likely,  it  will  prove  unnecessary, burdensome, and perhaps even contrary to what more careful consideration would reveal to be the underlying objectives.\n\nA  second  imperative,  once  public  policy  objectives  are  clearly  specified,  is  to evaluate  whether  government  regulation  is  necessary  for  those  purposes.  In  making  such evaluations, it is critically important to recognize that no market is ever truly unregulated. The self-interest of market participants generates private market regulation. Thus, the real question is not  whether  a  market  should  be  regulated.  Rather,  the  real  question  is  whether  government intervention strengthens or weakens  private regulation. If incentives for private  market regulation  are  weak  or  if  market  participants  lack  the  capabilities  to  pursue  their  interests effectively,  then  the  introduction  of  government  regulation  may  improve  regulation.  But  if private  market  regulation  is  effective,  then  government  regulation  is  at  best  unnecessary.  At worst,  the  introduction  of  government  regulation  may  actually  weaken  the  effectiveness  of regulation  if  government  regulation  is  itself  ineffective  or  undermines  incentives  for  private market  regulation.  We  must  be  aware  that  government  regulation  unavoidably  involves  some\n\nelement of moral hazard -- if private market participants believe that government is protecting their interests, their own efforts to protect their interests will diminish to some degree.\n\nWhether government regulation is needed,  and  if  so,  what  form  of  government regulation  is  optimal,  depends  critically  on  a  market's  characteristics.  A  'one-size-fits-all' approach  to  financial  market  regulation  is  almost  never  appropriate.  The  degree  and  type  of government regulation needed, if any, depends on the types of instruments traded, the types of market participants, and the nature of the relationships among market participants. To cite just one example, a government regulatory framework designed to protect retail investors from fraud or insolvency of brokers is unlikely to be necessary -- and is almost sure to be suboptimal -- if applied to a market in which large institutions transact on a principal-to-principal basis.\n\nRecognizing  that  a  one-size-fits-all  approach  is  seldom  appropriate,  it  may  be useful to offer transactors a choice between seeking the benefits and accepting the burdens of government regulation, or forgoing those benefits and avoiding those burdens by transacting in financial markets that are only privately regulated. In such circumstances, the privately regulated markets in effect provide a market test of the net benefits of government regulation. Migration of activity  from  government-regulated  to  privately  regulated  markets  sends  a signal to government regulators that many transactors believe the costs of regulation exceed the benefits. When  such  migration  occurs,  government  regulators  should  consider  carefully  whether  less regulation or different regulation would provide a better cost-benefit tradeoff without compromising public policy objectives.\n\n## Historical Development of U.S. Government Regulation of Derivative Markets\n\nBefore evaluating the current regulation of derivatives in light of these considerations, it is quite useful to know something of the history of these instruments and their regulation.  Derivative  contracts  (forward  contracts  and  options)  appear  to  have  been  utilized throughout American history. Indeed, it will probably come as a surprise even to this audience that 15 to 25 percent of trades on the New York Stock Exchange in its early years were time bargains, that is, forward contracts, rather than transactions for cash settlement (in those days, same-day settlement) or regular-way settlement (next-day settlement). In the case of commodities,  forward  contracts  for  corn,  wheat,  and  other  grains  came  into  common  use  by 1850 in Chicago, where they were known as 'to arrive' contracts. The first organized futures exchange  in  the  United  States,  the  Chicago  Board  of  Trade,  evolved  through  the  progressive standardization  of  the  terms  of  'to  arrive'  contracts,  including  lot  sizes,  grades  of  grain,  and delivery  periods.  Trading  apparently  was  centralized  on  the  Board  of  Trade  by  1859,  and  in 1865 it set out detailed rules for the trading of highly standardized contracts quite similar to the grain futures contracts traded today.\n\nThe first  recorded  instance  of  federal  government  regulation  of  derivatives  was the  Anti-Gold  Futures  Act  of  1864,  which  prohibited  the  trading  of  gold  futures.  The government had been unhappy that its fiat currency issues, the infamous greenbacks, were at that time  trading  at  a  substantial  discount  to  gold.  Unwilling  to  accept  this  result  as  evidence  of failure  of  the  government's  monetary  policies,  Congress  concluded  that  it  was  evidence  of  a serious failure of private market regulation. In the event, Congress's action was followed by a further sharp drop in the value of the greenbacks. Although it took the government many years to restore monetary policy to a sound footing, it took Congress only two weeks to conclude that its prohibition of gold futures was having unintended consequences and to repeal the act.\n\nIt has been the trading of agricultural futures, however, that from its inception has produced calls for government intervention. Throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, farmers were often opposed to futures trading, particularly during periods when prices of  their  products  were  low  or  declining.  They  presumed  that  dreaded  speculators  were depressing their prices. The states were the first to respond to calls for government regulation of futures.  For  the  most  part,  state  legislation  on  futures  was  limited  to  prohibitions  on  bucket shops, that is, operations that purport to act as brokers of exchange-traded futures but 'bucket' rather than execute their clients' trades. An Illinois statute of 1874 signaled early concerns about market integrity. The statute criminalized the spreading of false rumors to influence commodity prices and attempts to corner commodity markets.\n\nAfter its  misadventure  with  futures  regulation  during  the  Civil  War,  the  federal government appears not to have given further consideration to regulating futures trading until 1883, when a  bill  was  introduced  in  Congress  to  prohibit  use  of  the  mails  to  market  futures. Thereafter, repeated efforts were made to regulate or prohibit trading of futures and options on agricultural products. When the Agriculture Department reviewed the Congressional Record in 1920,  it  found  that  164  measures  of  this  sort  had  previously  been  introduced.  These  efforts culminated  in  passage  of  the  Futures  Trading  Act  of  1921.  That  act  was  promptly  declared unconstitutional  by  the  Supreme  Court,  on  the  grounds  that  it  was  a  regulatory  measure masquerading as a tax measure. But in 1922 Congress restated the purpose of the 1921 act as 'an act  for  the  prevention  and  removal  of  obstructions  and  burdens  upon  interstate  commerce  in grain, by regulating transactions on grain futures exchanges,' and renamed it the Grain Futures Act of 1922. As an explicitly regulatory measure, it was later upheld by the Court.\n\nThe  objective  of  the  Grain  Futures  Act  was  to  reduce  or  eliminate  'sudden  or unreasonable fluctuations' in the prices of grain on futures exchanges. The framers of the act believed  that  such  sudden  or  unreasonable  fluctuations  of  grain  futures  prices  reflected  their susceptibility  to  'speculation,  manipulation,  or  control.'  Moreover,  such  fluctuations  in  price were seen to have broad  ramifications  that  affected  the  national  public  interest.  Grain  futures contracts  were  widely  used  by  producers  and  distributors  of  grain  to  hedge  the  risks  of  price fluctuations.  Futures  prices  also  were  widely  disseminated  and  widely  used  as  the  basis  for pricing  grain  transactions  off  the  futures  exchanges.  Indeed,  given  the  relative  size  of  the agricultural sector of the time, fluctuations in futures prices no doubt had the potential to affect the economy as a whole.\n\nIt is not entirely clear that the view that futures trading was exacerbating volatility in agricultural prices was well-founded. To be sure, evidence abounds that market participants talked  incessantly  about  corners  and  bear  raids.  Moreover,  the  design  of  the  contracts  may, indeed,  have  made  such  contracts  susceptible  to  manipulation.  However,  empirical  studies  of more recent  experience  cast  doubt  on  whether  the  use  of  derivatives  adds  to  price  volatility. And, while charges of market manipulation are heard to this day, they typically are difficult, if not impossible, to prove. Professional speculators were easy to blame for fluctuations in market prices  that  actually  reflected  fundamental  shifts  in  supply  or  demand,  as  they  are  today.  The market clearing process is a very abstract concept. It is sometimes far easier to envisage price changes as the consequence of individual manipulators. Indeed, for a lot of nineteenth-century ring  traders,  it  was  some  measure  of  manhood  (women  were  few)  that  they  could  squeeze  or corner a market. The evidence suggests that this was largely Walter Middy-type fantasy.\n\nIn any event, the Grain Futures Act of 1922 established many of the key elements of our current regulatory framework for derivatives. In general, the act was designed to confine futures  trading  to  regulated  futures  exchanges.  The  act  made  it  unlawful  to  trade  futures  on\n\nexchanges other than those designated as contract markets by the Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary was permitted to so designate an exchange only if certain conditions were met. These included the establishment of procedures for recordkeeping and reporting of futures transactions, for  prevention  of  dissemination  of  false  or  misleading  crop  or  market  information,  and  for prevention of price manipulation or cornering of markets. Finally, the act recognized the need to permit  bona  fide  derivatives  transactions  to  be  executed  off  of  the  regulated  exchanges;  it explicitly  excluded  forward  contracts  for  the  delivery  of  grain  from  the  exchange-trading requirement. Forward contracts were essentially defined as contracts for future delivery to which farmers or farm interests were counterparties or in which the seller, if not a farmer, owned the grain at the time of making the contract.\n\nThe  next  major  piece  of  federal  legislation  affecting  futures  regulation  was  the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) of 1936. As in the case of the Grain Futures Act, an important objective  of  the  CEA  was  to  discourage  forms  of  speculation  that  were  seen  as  exacerbating price volatility. In addition, the CEA introduced provisions designed primarily to protect small investors  in  commodity  futures,  whose  participation  had  been  increasing  and  was  viewed  as beneficial.  These  provisions  included  requirements  for  the  registration  of  futures  commission merchants (FCMs), that is, futures brokers, and for the segregation of customer funds from FCM funds. The CEA also expanded the coverage of futures regulation to cover contracts for cotton, rice,  and  certain  other  specifically  enumerated  commodities  traded  on  futures  exchanges,  and prohibited the trading of options on commodities traded on futures exchanges.\n\nThe federal regulatory framework for derivatives market regulation then remained substantially  unchanged  until  1974,  when  Congress  enacted  the  Commodity  Futures  Trading Commission Act. The act did not make any fundamental changes in the objectives of derivatives regulation.  However,  it  expanded  the  scope  of  the  CEA  quite  significantly.  In  addition  to creating  the  Commodity  Futures  Trading  Commission  (CFTC)  as  an  independent  agency  and giving the  CFTC  exclusive  jurisdiction  over commodity  futures  and  options,  the  1974 amendments  expanded  the  CEA's  definition  of  'commodity'  beyond  a  specific  list of agricultural  commodities  to  include  'all  other  goods  and  articles,  except  onions,  .  .  .  and  all services, rights, and interests in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.' In one respect, this was sweeping deregulation, in that it explicitly allowed the trading on  futures  exchanges  of  contracts  on  virtually  any  underlying  assets,  including  financial instruments.  Only  onion  futures,  banned  in  1958  as  the  presumed  favorite  plaything  of manipulators,  remained  beyond  the  pale.  In  another  respect,  however,  this  was  a  sweeping extension  of  regulation.  Given  this  broad  definition  of  a  commodity  and  an  equally  broad interpretation of what constitutes a futures contract, this change brought a tremendous range of off-exchange  transactions  potentially  within  the  scope  of  the  CEA.  In  particular,  it  could  be interpreted  to  extend  the  broad  prohibition  on  off-exchange  trading  of  futures  to  an  immense volume of diverse transactions that never had been traded on exchanges.\n\nThe potential for  the  legality  of  a  wider  range  of  transactions  to  be  called  into question  did  not  go  unnoticed  during  debate  on  the  1974  act.  In  particular,  the  Treasury Department  proposed  language  excluding  off-exchange  derivative  transactions in foreign currency,  government  securities,  and  certain  other  financial  instruments  from  the  newly expanded  CEA.  This  proposal  was  adopted  by  Congress  and  is  known  as  the  Treasury Amendment. In proposing the  amendment,  Treasury  was  primarily  concerned  with  protecting foreign  exchange  markets  from  what  it  considered  unnecessary  and  potentially  harmful regulation.  The  foreign  exchange  markets  clearly  have  quite  different  characteristics  from markets for agricultural futures -- the  markets  for  the  major  currencies  are  deep  and,  as  some central banks have learned the hard way, they are extremely difficult to manipulate.\n\nFurthermore, participants in those markets, primarily banks and other financial institutions, and large corporations, would not seem to need, and certainly are not seeking, the protection of the CEA. Thus, there was, and is, no reason to presume that the regulatory framework of the CEA needs to be applied to the foreign exchange markets to achieve the public policy objectives that motivated  the  CEA.  Indeed,  the  wholesale  foreign  exchange  markets  provide  a  clear  and compelling  example  of  how  private  parties  can  regulate  markets  quite  effectively  without government assistance.\n\nBIS Review   19/1997",

         "Mr. George conveys his reflections on the development of bond market yields over recent years  (Central Bank Articles and Speeches, 25 Feb 97)",
         "Remarks by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. E.A.J. George, at the Euromoney International Bond Congress held in London on 25/2/97.",
         "Mr. George conveys his reflections on the development of bond market yields over recent years Remarks by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. E.A.J. George, at the Euromoney International Bond Congress held in London on 25/2/97.\n\nI'm  honoured  to  have  been  invited  to  open  this  3rd  Euromoney  International Bond  Congress.    I  remember  with  great  pleasure  launching  your  initial  Congress  in  October 1994 in the Barbican.  It is an even greater pleasure now to launch the QEII!  That first Congress was an ambitious and imaginative venture.  But it immediately established itself as a major event in the international financial calendar.  I congratulate Euromoney on that achievement, and, to judge  from  the  program,  on  organising  an  even  bigger  and  better  Congress  on  this  third occasion.  I am delighted to welcome you all here.\n\nI remember our debate at that first Congress particularly well, Mr. Chairman.  I remember it  because  I  looked  up  my  notes  over  the  weekend!    The  context  then  was  one  in which yields had fallen very sharply, to unusually low levels, almost everywhere during 1993 only  to  back  up  just  as  sharply  during  1994.    We  concluded,  I  think,  that  none  of  us  really understood either the earlier strength of the market or its subsequent weakness!  But we had a very enjoyable two days of discussion.\n\nOne concern at the time was that we were facing a global capital shortage, with increasing  demand  from  the  emerging,  transitioning  and  developing  countries  at  a  time  of strengthening  economic  activity  and  large  government  deficits  across  the  industrial  world. Referring generally in my remarks this morning to 10 year maturities, real yields - measured by our own indexed gilts - had indeed risen in 1994 by ¾% or more to close to 4%.  But nominal yields had risen by substantially more - by something like 2% in the major markets - reflecting increased uncertainty no doubt, but clearly also worsening inflationary expectations.\n\nIn my remarks on that occasion, I ventured to suggest that bond markets might just be exaggerating at least the inflationary risks, by underestimating three factors in particular:\n\nFirst, the commitment of governments and central banks all around the world to disciplined macro-economic policies.\n\nSecondly, the restraining effect of both the level of real yields and of structural unemployment particularly in Europe.\n\nAnd thirdly, the counter-inflationary effect of global competition and technological innovation.\n\nNow I seem to recollect that this suggestion was met with a degree of scepticism. That  was  not  at  all  surprising.    You  had  all  heard  that  sort  of  optimism  from  the  authorities before!\n\nBut the fact is that since around the time of that first Euromoney Congress bond yields have nevertheless trended fairly consistently lower, and are now in many cases close to or even below the low point they had reached around the end of 1993.  Real yields, again measured by our own indexed gilts have fallen back to a little more than 3¼%;  and the first US indexed bond issue yields much the same.  And nominal yields have fallen by 200 basis points or more in continental Europe and Japan - though rather less in the United States and the UK.  There has been  more  excitement  in  the  foreign  exchange  market,  with  the  dollar  in  particular  first weakening against the yen and the major continental currencies until the spring of 1995 and then progressively recovering.\n\nThese developments were certainly influenced by the factors which I mentioned a moment  ago.    In  particular  they  have  been  influenced  by  the  continuing  broadly-based consensus - in countries all around the world, and across a large part of the political spectrum within countries - on the importance of macro-economic policy discipline.\n\nMacro-economic policy is no longer seen as an instrument for short-term demand management, which can be used to trade-off the conflicting demands of growth and stability in the short run.  It is now much more widely understood and accepted that the rate of growth that can be sustained, or the level of employment that can be achieved and maintained in anything other than the short run, depend fundamentally on the structural, supply-side, characteristics of the  economy,  and  not  just  on  the  level  of  demand.    So  today's  orthodoxy  ascribes  to macro-economic policy the job of keeping demand in line with the capacity of the economy to meet that demand in the medium and longer term.\n\nWithin this overall framework, monetary policy is allocated the specific task of achieving and maintaining effective price stability.  This is not, as some commentators still seem to  suggest,  simply  some  doctrinaire  end  in  itself.    Inflation  is  seen  rather  as  a  symptom  of imbalance between demand and supply in the economy.  So what we are essentially aiming to do through monetary policy is to anticipate the emergence of that imbalance and head it off before it  becomes entrenched.  If we are successful in that, inflation will be lower, there will be less need  for  violent  interest  rate  movements  than  in  the  past,  and  the  economy  will  grow  at  a steadier, and more sustainable and predictable, rate.  That, in turn, will encourage more rational, longer-term, economic decision-making and investment, which will help indirectly to improve underlying, supply-side, performance.\n\nSimilarly, today's macro-economic orthodoxy requires fiscal policy to be directed to restricting government borrowing to levels that can be sustained into the medium and longer term,  without  either  forcing  up  real  yields  or  implying  the  prospective  need  for  progressively rising  tax  rates  -  which  could  otherwise  damage  the  development  of  private  sector  economic activity.\n\nNow  in  some  respects  we  have  made  considerable  progress  over  the  past  two years and more.  Inflation in many countries - including virtually all the industrial countries but not confined to them - is now consistently lower than it has been for ages.  That in itself has contributed to lower interest rates and to the lower nominal bond yields that I have described. But,  in  addition  to  that,  fiscal  consolidation,  which  has  lowered  the  combined  government deficits of the G7 countries from around $600 billion in 1994 to around $540 billion last year, has  helped  to  reduce  real  yields,  notwithstanding  the  continuing  demand  for  capital  from  the developing world.  And the really good news is that this macro-economic discipline has been accompanied  by  sustained  economic  expansion,  with  world  GDP  as  a  whole  growing  at  an annual rate of some 3½ - 4%.\n\nNow of course there have been quite marked differences in the performance  of individual countries within this overall picture.  Some of the transition economies have seen a brutal  contraction  of  output  which  is  only  now  beginning  to  stabilise.    And  there  have  been marked fluctuations in the growth rates of some of the emerging countries.  Growth in parts of Asia,  for  example,  is  now  moderating,  cyclically,  to  a  more  sustainable  pace,  while  parts  of Latin America continue to recover from the set-back they suffered two years ago.\n\nAmong the industrial countries, too, economic developments have diverged over the  past  two  years.    In  the  United  States  and  in  this  country,  for  example,  inflation  has  been\n\ncontained to around 3% with continuing growth and  low  or  falling  unemployment.    And  this pattern looks set to continue.  In Japan and on the Continent of Europe, on the other hand, while inflation has been even lower, activity has been disappointingly weak, and unemployment on the Continent at least has risen to quite frightening levels.  And while there is now the prospect of a moderate pick-up in activity in these countries, that is not yet assured.  Japan, which is in many respects a unique case, faces substantial fiscal consolidation.  And in Europe, too, the prospects are  clouded  by  pressure  to  bring  budget  deficits  down  sufficiently  to  meet  the  Maastricht convergence criteria this year, notwithstanding the weakness of the domestic economies, and in an environment of longer term structural inflexibility.\n\nThese divergent developments go a long way towards explaining recent differences in the behaviour of both bond markets and exchange rates.\n\nIn  both  the  United  States  and  the  United  Kingdom  the  sustained  expansion  of domestic demand and of ouput has generated market expectations of an essentially cyclical rise in short-term interest rates.  Sluggish economic activity elsewhere, on the other hand, means not only  that  short-term  interest  rates  are  significantly  lower  in  Japan  and  the  core  European countries;  but it also means that they are thought, by the market, to be less immediately likely to rise.    This  cyclical  difference  in  the  short-term  interest  rate  prospect  largely  explains  the pronounced yield differential between the US and the UK and the other countries  at  the  very short end of the curve.  Out to 2 years, for example, whereas yields in the US and UK are within ½% either side of 6%, yields in Germany and France are below 3½%, and they are below ½% in Japan.    These  differences  in  the  short-term  interest  rate  prospects  feed  through  into  yield differentials  on  longer  term  bonds,  and  changes  in  them  also  help  to  explain  the  recent movements in exchange rates.\n\nBut rather more interesting is the relative slopes of the yield curves further ahead, US and UK yields are only about 1% above present short-term yields,  at +/-7%;  but they are 3% or more above present short term yields in Germany and France, also at +/-7%;  and they are 3% higher than short-term yields even in Japan, at 3¾%.  The implication is that, if you abstract from  immediate  cyclical  influences,  longer-term  economic  performance  -  and  particularly performance with respect to inflation - is not expected to be very different between the major countries, though Japan remains an outlier.\n\nIt is difficult to know what interpretation to put on this observation.  The fact that the yield curves in Germany and France are practically identical is consistent at least with EMU going ahead - at least with a narrow membership.  But the steep rise in implied future yields five years ahead suggests that inflation is expected to be higher in the medium term.  That could be associated  with  expectations  of  softer  macro-economic  discipline,  perhaps  more  specifically reflecting market uncertainty about EMU in the light of the ongoing debate about prospective membership and about how far the ECB will in practice be free to pursue its statutory task of maintaining  price  stability.    It  may,  on  the  other  hand,  simply  reflect  some  kind  of  market imperfection.\n\nThe same analysis can be applied to Italy and Spain, for example, to try to assess market expectations about their possible membership of EMU as part of the first wave.  It shows that notwithstanding the recent falls in short-term interest rates  in  those  countries  -  which  can largely be explained by their improved economic performance - 5 years forward yields remain significantly higher than those in Germany and France suggesting that early EMU membership is not at all certain in the eyes of the markets.\n\nWhat can we conclude from all this, Mr. Chairman?  Well, the conclusions that I draw are essentially threefold and hardly very surprising.\n\nI conclude, first, that markets at present are reasonably persuaded that the world economy as a whole will remain relatively stable at least by comparison with much of the post war period.  Excluding short-term influences, bond yields in the major countries - apart from the special case of Japan - are converging around a level of around 7% which suggests that relative macro-economic, monetary and fiscal discipline will be sustained, though it will stop short of effective price stability.\n\nI conclude, secondly, that the markets see current developments in the US and the UK as essentially cyclical;  and that they anticipate a pick-up in activity elsewhere somewhat further ahead.\n\nAnd I conclude, thirdly, that there remains some considerable uncertainty about the prospect for European Monetary Union, in particular about its initial membership but also about the extent of the discipline it will involve.\n\nNow, of course, these conclusions are based on the bond markets as they currently are, which is a bit like forecasting the past!  What you really need to know is how the markets will evolve in the future.  Happily it is not my task to venture down that path.  It is during our next session that the market experts will seek to 'forecast the future'.  But I do hope they will tell  us  whether they agree  that  relative  stability  will  indeed  persist,  in  the  medium  and  longer term, how they see the different national situations evolving in the more immediate future, and what prospects they see for EMU.  These seem to me to be the key issues for the future and I look forward to listening to what they have to say.\n\nBIS Review   22/1997",

         "Statement by the Governor of the Bank of Italy, Dott. Antonio Fazio, before the Chambre of Commerce of the Senate of the Italian Republic in Rome on 25/2/97.",
         "Mr. Fazio discusses the current situation as regards the prevention and repression of money laundering in the financial system in Italy Statement by the Governor of the Bank of Italy, Dott. Antonio Fazio, before the Chambre of Commerce of the Senate of the Italian Republic in Rome on 25/2/97.\n\nIn my statement to this Committee in October 1994 I focused on the new legal framework for finance and credit, the role of the supervisory authorities and intermediaries in combatting illegal activities, and cooperation with the governmental authorities directly involved in the fight against organized crime.\n\nIn the last two years the broad context has changed and evolved. Progress has been made in developing the analysis of financial offences, instruments for preventing and repressing them.\n\nThe investment services Directive has been transposed; the law against usury has been approved. The cooperation between the Bank of Italy, intermediaries and law enforcement and judicial authorities has been further strengthened.\n\n## 1. Adverse effects of criminal activity and money laundering on the economy and finance\n\nMy contribution today takes account of the experience of the Bank of Italy and that of the UIC; since 1991 the latter has been entrusted by law with special tasks in the antimoney-laundering field.\n\nThe repercussions of criminal activity on the economy and finance involve the supervisory function of the central bank and its responsibility for safeguarding monetary stability. Money is a typically and purely fiduciary value. It is indispensable that citizens should be aware that the State, through its institutions, guarantees the security and prompt execution of exchanges; financial enterprises must be able to operate in an efficient, correct and transparent manner.\n\nIn the first place it is necessary to prevent financial resources of illicit origin from entering the legitimate economy through the creation of new intermediaries or the acquisition of existing ones. Analogous, and equally serious, problems, exist in other sectors, notably the distributive trades. It is necessary to ensure that illicit resources cannot influence the ordinary course of financial intermediation.\n\nThe proper functioning of the market requires compliance with fundamental ethical rules. Correct behaviour is an economic value in itself; it enhances the strength and security of economic agents.\n\nThe existence of economic agents and structures in collusion with organized crime profoundly modifies the mechanisms of the market with respect to rules and objectives, distorts competition.\n\nThe gap between the level of economic development in the various regions of Italy is due to a considerable extent to inadequate economic and social infrastructure; shortcomings in the public administration and the slowness of the judicial system are other contributory factors.\n\nOrganized crime exploits the situation of underemployment in the depressed areas; to the socially weaker members of the community it appears as an economic force and even as a system of values, which undermines ethical principles and social solidarity.\n\nIt is possible to attack criminal organizations in the phase of infiltrating money into the legal financial circuits. This task is the responsibility of the law enforcement authorities and those entrusted with the control of the financial system; it requires full and convinced support on the part of agents and intermediaries.\n\nThe supervisory authorities of the leading industrial countries are aware of the threat to the integrity and stability of intermediaries posed by illicit capital. Increasing efforts are\n\nbeing made to prepare weapons and defences with which to prevent contagion by criminal activities and the related instability of financial systems.\n\n## 2. The international dimension of the money laundering problem\n\nThe removal of the restrictions and controls on capital movements and the emergence of a global market for credit, foreign exchange and securities have undoubtedly facilitated the international laundering of the proceeds of criminal activities.\n\nThe size of the phenomenon is difficult to gauge, but certainly considerable.\n\nThe authorities of the leading countries have defined a set of measures that should be embodied in all their legal systems in order to make prevention and repression more effective. The aim is to achieve uniform behaviour in the face of the phenomenon.\n\nThe recommendations of the international Financial Task Force set up within the Group of Seven and Community Directive 1991/308 contain clear guidelines and prescriptions, especially for EU countries.\n\nInternational organizations are seeking to take more direct steps, in the first place with respect to countries that appear reluctant to introduce anti-money-laundering provisions into their legal systems.\n\nThe effectiveness of such provisions is reduced by the tolerant attitude towards money laundering in some countries, the so-called off shore centres, a classification that stretches to include independent territories and states in various continents.\n\nThe protection offered by banking secrecy that is impenetrable even for criminal investigators, shortcomings in legislation or the lack thereof, problems in cooperating with local judicial authorities and difficulty in supervising intermediaries make it particularly easy in some financial centres to launder money of illicit origin.\n\nIn the case of branches and subsidiaries of international banks located in such centres, the controls of the parent bank and the supervisory authorities are sometimes made impossible or at any rate difficult. Since 1992 the Bank of Italy has adopted a restrictive stance to Italian banks setting up establishments in some off-shore centres; no new establishments have been authorized.\n\nIn this field the Italian regulatory framework reflects the progress made by the agreements among the Group of Ten countries.\n\nThe choice of such financial centres for the laundering of illicit proceeds is also due to factors that in any case attract financial resources and intermediaries, including particularly favourable tax regimes.\n\nThe use of electronic money in all its various forms has attracted the attention of supervisory authorities to the vulnerable points these new instruments introduce into the system of defence against money laundering. The nature, speed and volume of transactions tend to hinder the detection and reconstruction of anomalous financial operations. The greatest concern arises in connection with the issue of electronic money by financial businesses not subject to supervision.\n\nAwareness of the seriousness of the problems has stimulated the renewed drive by the international community to react in several directions with measures aimed at fighting the circulation of funds deriving from criminal activities at the level of supervision and tax harmonization.\n\nOne route to limit the flows of dirty money towards lax financial centres is to require the financial institutions of countries where legislation is adequate to report transactions lacking an obvious licit economic motive in which the counterparty is located in a country with inadequate defences.\n\nThe top priority must be to improve the quality of supervision and the reliability of financial intermediaries. Steps are being taken in this direction by the Basle Banking\n\nSupervision Committee, which is working to promote the adoption of minimum standards in the emerging countries.\n\nThe problem of tax harmonization in Europe and the OECD countries remains highly topical. It has been raised on several occasions in the Group of Seven and the European Union and there appears to be renewed recognition of its importance on the part of the leading countries. The OECD is carrying out analyses, but progress is slow and laborious.\n\nThe Republic of San Marino introduced a number of statutory provisions on money laundering in the spring of 1996. A bilateral committee is currently evaluating the degree of conformity with EU and Italian standards.\n\n## 3. Illegal finance and usury\n\nIn Italy, despite the large increase in the number of bank branches, there continues to be a far from negligible area of unauthorized financial activity, in terms of both lending and fund-raising.\n\nUsury feeds on this situation and is a cause for alarm. As I had occasion to point out in my concluding remarks to the Bank's general meeting on 31 May 1996, usury is a complex phenomenon and first and foremost a problem of public order.\n\nUsury preys on households, as well as small commercial and artisan businesses, which more often than not are no longer considered creditworthy. It often provides the means for organized crime to infiltrate the legitimate productive economy. The present difficult phase that the economy is passing through increases the risk of the phenomenon spreading.\n\nBanks, especially local and cooperative banks, have been spurred by the Bank of Italy to pay increased attention to the needs of smaller firms and guide them towards appropriate forms of financial planning.\n\nNumerous initiatives are designed to simplify dealings with customers and speed up decisions on loan applications. In this respect the code of conduct prepared by the Italian Bankers' Association (ABI) and the protocols between intermediaries and local businessmen's associations are of particular importance. Funds have been earmarked by some large banks for the financing of persons in temporary difficulty and consequently exposed to the risk of usury. These funds supplement those of a public nature provided for in the new law for purposes of prevention and solidarity, which will be activated this year.\n\nIn the background there remains the need to educate households and firms to use money and financing responsibly. Prevention calls for full awareness of the dangers of borrowing from illegal sources of finance.\n\nThe new law on usury appears to be appropriately based on an overall view of the phenomenon. There nonetheless remain causes for concern, as has been frequently pointed out, concerning the possible adverse consequences of introducing \"threshold rate\" for regulated intermediaries. As I put it on another occasion, \"The specification of a usurious rate of interest is intended to provide an objective yardstick for determining the existence of a crime. The limits established and their application to regulated intermediaries may push up interest rates for smaller loans, lead to the rationing of credit to marginal, weaker customers.\"\n\nThe Bank of Italy and the UIC are engaged in the complex task of gathering data on the interest rates charged by banks and other financial intermediaries for different size classes and types of loans. A start has been made on analysing the information collected with a view to the publication of the related ministerial decree. The Bank of Italy and the UIC are committed to providing the support needed to ensure a correct understanding and use of the data gathered.\n\nThe law requires every form of financial intermediation to be inserted in a predetermined legal framework. The territorial control entrusted to governmental authorities, including the Bank of Italy for the matters assigned to it, is of fundamental importance.\n\nBanks that learn of the existence of unauthorized organizations notify the Bank of Italy. In turn the Bank provides feedback for the purpose of prevention and informs the competent authorities.\n\nMore decisive steps have been taken to forestall and punish improper behaviour by employees of financial intermediaries. Safeguards have been introduced to protect against false representations to banks and breach of trust in the management of securities portfolios with the aim of contributing to the regularity and transparency of dealings between intermediaries and their customers.\n\n## 4. The activity of the Bank of Italy in preventing and repressing money laundering\n\nEven unwitting involvement by an intermediary in circulating money of illicit provenance will undermine its sound and prudent management in the end.\n\nA particularly delicate moment is the market-entry of new intermediaries, especially the opening of new banks.\n\nThe Bank of Italy's Supervision Department carries out controls on market entry; in particular, it examines ownership structure and organizational arrangements, and verifies compliance with the integrity and experience requirements for corporate officers.\n\nIn the three years 1994-96, 75 applications to open new banks were considered and 57 approved; of the 18 non-approvals, 16 concerned Southern Italy. Authorization was denied on account of the presence of corporate officers or owners who could not be trusted for the purposes of sound and prudent management and, in some instances, were suspected of collusion with organized crime. These decisions were upheld in administrative appeal proceedings.\n\nSupervisory action is performed continuously through documentary control of the operational indicators and frequent meetings with banks' officers. On-site verifications are carried out regularly and systematically. These inspections supplement the documentary controls and are designed to assess banks' ability to engage in the collection and investment of savings in a correct manner, in accordance with criteria of sound and prudent management and all the legal requirements.\n\nInspections are not specifically designed to discover possible violations of criminal law. If a case of irregular conduct is found, its technical and legal aspects are carefully examined. Cases that may constitute crimes are resorted to the judicial authorities.\n\nFor its own aims of banking and financial supervision, the Bank of Italy has conducted 563 inspections in the last three years. Sixty per cent of Italy's banks were examined -68 per cent of all those established in the South and 57 per cent of those in the Centre and North.\n\nFollowing a number of these inspections the Bank of Italy submitted proposals to the Treasury Minister for the adoption of disciplinary measures for serious operational irregularities involving large capital losses. In particular, 25 banks were put into special administration, which entails the dissolution of their boards of directors and auditors. Fifteen banks were put into compulsory administrative liquidation.\n\nThe penal proceedings now under way will clarify whether there were instances of money laundering or collusion with criminal organizations.\n\nThe Bank submitted proposals to the Minister for pecuniary sanctions to be levied against 2,779 officers of more than 200 intermediaries.\n\nThe anti-laundering rules -Law 197/1997 -rely on the faithful collaboration of intermediaries. This takes the form of preparing a \"trail\" of the transactions they have effected, for use in possible investigations, and of reporting on any suspicions provoked by specific transactions on the technical and financial plane.\n\nThe rules:\n\n- ¢ set limits to the use of cash,\n- ¢ prohibit the making of payments by unauthorized intermediaries,\n* require the identification of customers and the registration of significant transactions, and\n- ¢ make it compulsory to report suspicious transactions.\n\nThe regular performance of credit and financial activity depends on intermediaries' having adequate information on every customer.\n\nTo assist in the identification of suspicious transactions, the Bank of Italy has published a \"decalogue\" systematically setting out examples of anomalies whose presence requires the various aspects of the transaction to be scrutinzied and, possibly, a report to be filed.\n\nIntermediaries are required to consider the objective features of a transaction and to compare them with the characteristics of the person making it in order to detect possible anomalies. Standardized schemas cannot take the place of careful transaction analysis and assessment by intermediaries' employees. The law calls for this kind of evaluation.\n\nThe difficulties initially encountered by the financial system are being overcome and the flow of reports has increased considerably. In 1996 the Finance Police received 3,075 reports, most of them from banks. There is growing understanding and support for the law's objectives among intermediaries and operators. It remains necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the procedure and, for reasons of personal safety, the anonymity of the persons making reports.\n\n## 5. The activity of the UIC\n\nThe UIC's essential, traditional tasks are the management of the foreign reserves and the collection and processing of the statistics needed to compile Italy's balance of payments and the related publications.\n\nIn 1991 Law 197 assigned the UIC a central role in administrative action to combat money laundering. The UIC, in agreement with the competent supervisory authorities, verifies intermediaries' compliance with the anti-laundering rules, keeps the register of companies in the financial sector, and does statistical studies using the aggregated data drawn from the databases of authorized intermediaries.\n\nThere were 21,318 financial companies in the register at the end of last year. Only 1,604 of them did business with the public; the rest were groups' dedicated financial companies (the great majority) or loan underwriting consortia.\n\nIn 1996 the UIC issued some 500 notices to companies regarding initial or subsequent failure to satisfy the requirements for entry in the register or findings of serious violations of law. Among companies that do business with the public, which are potentially more exposed to the risk of being used for illicit purposes, there were 120 deletions from the register and 72 new listings. For the financial sector as a whole, in the three years from 1994 to 1996 there were 3.803 de-listings and 1,571 new listings.\n\nIn 1995 a survey was made of all the banks' computerized data collection and database management procedures.\n\nBy the end of 1996 72 inspections aimed at verifying compliance with the antilaundering rules had been completed: these led to 40 reports being sent to the judicial authorities and 36 to the Treasury Minister for administrative infractions.\n\nThe main deficiencies found during the inspections were attributable primarily to organizational problems involving computerized procedures and inadequate internal controls.\n\nThe UIC is charged with monitoring the aggregated data originating from the company's single databases, with a view to bringing out anomalies that may signal money laundering. The anomalies are detected from among the mass of available data on the basis of a grid of essentially statistical criteria.\n\nData are collected from 2,000 authorized intermediaries. The number of operations subject to aggregation is more than 30 million a month, including some 10 million cash transactions.\n\nThis is a completely new field, and not just in Italy, and the UIC, in contact with leading research centres, has begun to experiment in depth with new methodologies designed to detect anomalous financial flows. Once the initial results are available the UIC will provide the competent bodies with indications that can be used in investigative activity.\n\nCareful methodological consideration has brought out the need for a deeper scientific analysis of the nature and manner of the links between the economy and organized crime.\n\nRepresentatives of the police forces and the judiciary, together with academic specialists, are collaborating with the newly formed \"Anti-Money-Laundering Observatory\". For now this body is strictly informal. It is a research facility established to investigate key aspects of the economy, organized crime and money laundering in particular, with a view to keeping preventive strategies abreast of the evolution of criminal techniques and the spread of the phenomenon to new sectors.\n\n## 6. Collaboration with the judicial authorities\n\nIn the last three years the Supervision Department has sent reports on 92 intermediaries to the criminal justice authorities. A steadily growing number of requests for data and technical information are being addressed to the Bank of Italy. Around 1,000 requests for information and documentation have been handled, and officers of the Bank have testified in 185 cases.\n\nExperts of the Bank of Italy and the UIC are increasingly engaged in technical advisory tasks: one fifth of the staff of the Central Supervision Inspectorate, that is to say some 30 officers, are assigned to such duties full-time. Major assistance is provided to the judicial and investigating authorities in examining aspects of the various types of money laundering and for refresher courses on technical points of the phenomena that may come under investigation.\n\nThere is intense collaboration with the law-enforcement agencies, especially the Finance Police, and with the Racket and Usury Bureau.\n\nThe Bureau of Antimafia Investigation is kept up to date on serious management irregularities found at intermediaries operating in the regions most affected by organized crime. Contacts are under way to develop collaboration with the National Antimafia Bureau, for a better knowledge of money laundering techniques and for the exchange of information.\n\nUnder the legislation in force, the judicial authorities inform the Governor of the Bank of Italy, for the initiatives within his sphere of competence, when there is good reason to think that banks are involved in money laundering\n\nCases of possible fraud or money laundering connected with foreign undertakings established in countries which lack reliable controls are more and more frequently coming to the central bank's attention. These are the subject of exchanges of information with domestic and foreign authorities.\n\n## 7. The new shape of anti-money-laundering legislation\n\nThe current provisions against money laundering are not yet the outcome of systematic legislative intervention corresponding to a single logic. They are the result of accretion over time, as was underscored in the chapter of the Bank's 1995 Annual Report on supervisory activity.\n\nAccording to the Financial Action Task Force, the only deficiencies in the rules adopted in Italy are lack of full confidentiality of reports and failure to provide for a body that centralizes reports. The active collaboration requested of intermediaries is not protected by\n\nadequate safeguards for secrecy in reporting suspicious transactions. This entails obvious dangers for the safety of operators and creates obstacles to unreserved collaboration.\n\nThe occasion for rectifying these deficiencies is the delegation of legislative power under Article 15 of Law 52 of 6 February 1996, which establishes the criteria for completing the transposition into Italian law of Community Directive 308/1991 concerning measures to combat money laundering. Although the Directive takes the approach that laundering must be fought primarily with penal instruments, it underscores the fundamental role of collaboration by the financial system and the supervisory authorities.\n\nPolicymaking in the fight against money laundering is a prerogative of the Government. From a strategic point of view, the matter is essentially financial, and so it is natural for the central role to be entrusted to the Treasury Minister.\n\nAccording to the orientations that are emerging, the basic approach is, correctly, to keep the realm of financial controls distinct from that of investigative activity while ensuring the necessary coordination. The UIC would be made responsible for financial analysis and administrative control for the prevention of money laundering, to capitalize on the financial system's expertise in the fight against laundering.\n\nThe solution respects the distinction between administrative and investigative activity. There must be no mingling of these roles.\n\nReports of suspicious transactions would be routed through the UIC, which would subject them to technical examination and supplement the information with the aid of the sectoral supervisory authorities, for the purpose of immediate transmission to the lawenforcement authorities. The confidentiality of sources would be safeguarded even during an ensuing criminal investigation.\n\nThe same logic of coordination between different functions would be affirmed with regard to the significant findings of the statistical studies performed by the UIC.\n\nThe drafting of the codified law provided for by Law 52/1996 will make it possible to put prevention before repression and to restrict penal sanctions to conduct that is actually deviant with respect to standard operating practice. It is also necessary to specify other activities to which the anti-laundering requirements should be extended. These include security courier services, debt collection services and even some professional activities that are involved in various types of circulation of wealth in the form of securities and real estate.\n\n## Honourable Members of Parliament,\n\nThe acquisition by organized crime of instruments serving to control finance is an especially serious matter in that it can become a sort of multiplier of the criminals' strength and of the resulting contamination of the economy.\n\nAs far as the creation of new banks or the acquisition of existing ones is concerned, we are fully confident in the efficacy of prevention.\n\nIntercepting illicit capital during ordinary operations appears more problematic. As a rule, criminals cannot avoid using the normal financial channels, and the payment and funds transfer system operated by the banks is a natural conduit for funds of illegal provenance. These are a very small share of the total funds handled by the banks, so that identifying them is difficult in several respects.\n\nThe collaboration of intermediaries and of their operating staff is all-important. Reports of suspicious cases are on the rise. Those who file reports have to have greater assurances as to their safety and protection.\n\nTransfers of funds linked to illegal activities are becoming substantial in terms of absolute value and are tending to concentrate in particular regions, areas and intermediaries. Statistically-based studies are being conducted at the UIC, with promising results, to identify \"clusters\" of illicit capital that tend to move systematically from particular areas to others.\n\nThe Italian banking system is fully aware of the need for an unflagging effort to detect and eliminate these pathological phenomena and to accept the costs involved.\n\nThe Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has recognized the adequacy of Italy's legislation. It is necessary for the international community to avoid any tolerance, even tacit, for those financial centres and international banks that for profit-seeking motives operate in conditions of less-than-perfect transparency. Such attitudes subvert the rules of correct competition and, through the circulation of money of illegal provenance, the international economic order itself.\n\nThere must be growing awareness, extending beyond the circle of advanced countries, of the grave threat that the spread of criminal economic activity poses to the benefits of trade and financial liberalization.\n\nThe Bank of Italy and the UIC remain actively committed at the side of the governmental authorities in providing the necessary collaboration to prevent and combat financial crime, for the good of our nation and of the international community.\n\nBIS Review 39/1997",

         "Testimony of the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Mr. Alan Greenspan, before the Senate Banking Committee on 26/2/97.",
         "Mr. Greenspan presents the views of the Federal Reserve in its semi-annual report  on  monetary  policy Testimony  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Governors  of  the Federal  Reserve  System,  Mr.  Alan  Greenspan,  before  the  Senate  Banking  Committee  on 26/2/97.\n\nI  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  appear  before  this  Committee  to  present  the Federal Reserve's semiannual report on monetary policy.\n\nThe  performance  of  the  U.S.  economy  over  the  past  year  has  been  quite favorable.  Real GDP growth has picked up to more than three percent over the four quarters of 1996, as the economy progressed through its sixth year  of  expansion.  Employers  added  more than two-and-a-half million workers to their payrolls in 1996, and the unemployment rate fell further.  Nominal  wages  and  salaries  have  increased  faster  than  prices,  meaning  workers  have gained ground in real terms, reflecting the benefits of rising productivity. Outside the food and energy sectors, increases in consumer prices actually have continued to edge lower, with core CPI inflation only 2½ percent over the past twelve months.\n\nLow inflation last year was both a symptom and a cause of the good economy. It was symptomatic of the balance and solidity of the expansion and the evident absence of major strains  on  resources.  At  the  same  time,  continued  low  levels  of  inflation  and  inflation expectations have been a key support for healthy economic performance. They have helped to create  a  financial  and  economic  environment  conducive  to  strong  capital  spending  and longer-range  planning  generally,  and  so  to  sustained  economic  expansion.  Consequently,  the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) believes it is crucial to keep inflation contained in the near term and ultimately to move toward price stability.\n\nLooking ahead, the members of the FOMC expect inflation to remain low and the economy to grow appreciably  further.  However,  as  I  shall  be  discussing,  the  unusually  good inflation performance of recent years seems to owe in large part to some temporary factors, of uncertain longevity. Thus, the FOMC continues to see the distribution of inflation risks skewed to  the  upside  and  must  remain  especially  alert  to  the  possible  emergence  of  imbalances  in financial and product markets that ultimately could endanger the maintenance of the low-inflation environment. Sustainable economic expansion for 1997 and beyond depends on it.\n\nFor some, the benign inflation outcome of 1996 might be considered surprising, as  resource  utilization  rates  --  particularly  of  labor  --  were  in  the  neighborhood  of  those  that historically have been associated with building inflation pressures. To be sure, an acceleration in nominal labor compensation, especially its wage component, became evident over the past year. But  the  rate  of  pay  increase  still  was  markedly  less  than  historical  relationships  with  labor market conditions would have predicted. A typical restraint on compensation increases has been evident  for  a  few  years  now  and  appears  to  be  mainly  the  consequence  of  greater  worker insecurity.  In  1991,  at  the  bottom  of  the  recession,  a  survey  of  workers  at  large  firms  by International  Survey  Research  Corporation  indicated  that  25  percent  feared  being  laid  off.  In 1996, despite the sharply lower unemployment rate and the tighter labor market, the same survey organization found that 46 percent were fearful of a job layoff.\n\nThe  reluctance  of  workers  to  leave  their  jobs  to  seek  other  employment  as  the labor  market  tightened  has  provided  further  evidence  of  such  concern,  as  has  the  tendency toward longer labor union contracts. For many decades, contracts rarely exceeded three years. Today, one can point to five- and six-year contracts -- contracts that are commonly characterized\n\nby an emphasis on job security and that involve only modest wage increases. The low level of work stoppages of recent years also attests to concern about job security.\n\nThus, the willingness of workers in recent years to trade off smaller increases in wages  for  greater  job  security  seems  to  be  reasonably  well  documented.  The  unanswered question  is  why  this  insecurity  persisted  even  as  the  labor  market,  by  all  objective  measures, tightened considerably. One possibility may lie in the rapid evolution of technologies in use in the  work  place.  Technological  change  almost  surely  has  been  an  important  impetus  behind corporate restructuring and downsizing. Also, it contributes to the concern of workers that their job skills may become inadequate. No longer can one expect to obtain all of one's lifetime job skills  with  a  high-school  or  college  diploma.  Indeed,  continuing  education  is  perceived  to  be increasingly necessary to retain a job. The more pressing need to update job skills is doubtless also  a  factor  in  the  marked  expansion  of  on-the-job  training  programs,  especially  in  technical areas, in many of the nation's corporations.\n\nCertainly, other factors have contributed to the softness in compensation growth in the past few years. The sharp deceleration in health care costs, of course, is cited frequently. Another  is  the  heightened  pressure  on  firms  and  their  workers  in  industries  that  compete internationally.  Domestic  deregulation  has  had  similar  effects  on  the  intensity  of  competitive forces in some industries. In any event, although I do not doubt that all these factors are relevant, I would be surprised if they were nearly as important as job insecurity.\n\nIf heightened job insecurity is the most significant explanation of the break with the past in recent years, then it is important to recognize that, as I indicated in last February's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, suppressed wage cost growth as a consequence of job insecurity can be carried only so far. At some point, the tradeoff of subdued wage growth for job security has to come to an end. In other words, the relatively modest wage gains we have experienced are a temporary rather than a lasting phenomenon because there is a limit to the value of additional job  security  people  are  willing  to  acquire  in  exchange  for  lesser  increases  in  living  standards. Even if real wages were to remain permanently on a  lower  upward  track  than  otherwise  as  a result of the greater sense of insecurity, the rate of change of wages would revert at some point to a normal relationship with inflation. The unknown is when this transition period will end.\n\nIndeed,  some  recent  evidence  suggests  that  the  labor  markets  bear  especially careful watching for signs that the return to more normal patterns may be in process. The Bureau of  Labor  Statistics  reports  that  people  were  somewhat  more  willing  to  quit  their  jobs  to  seek other  employment  in  January  than previously. The  possibility that this reflects greater confidence by workers accords with a recent further rise in the percent of households responding to a Conference Board survey who perceive that job availability is plentiful. Of course, the job market has continued to be quite good recently; employment in January registered robust growth and initial claims for unemployment insurance have been at a relatively low level of late. Wages rose faster in 1996 than in 1995 by most measures, perhaps also raising questions about whether the transitional period of unusually slow wage gains may be drawing to a close.\n\nTo be sure, the pickup in wage gains has not shown through to underlying price inflation. Increases in the core CPI, as well as in several broader measures of prices, have stayed subdued or even edged off further in recent months. As best we can judge, faster productivity growth  last  year  meant  that  rising  compensation  gains  did  not  cause  labor  costs  per  unit  of output  to  increase  any  more  rapidly.  Non-labor  costs,  which  are  roughly  a  quarter  of  total consolidated costs of the nonfinancial corporate sector, were little changed in 1996.\n\nOwing in part to this subdued behavior of unit costs, profits and rates of return on capital have risen to high levels. As a consequence, businesses believe that, were they to raise prices to boost profits further, competitors with already ample profit margins would not follow suit;  instead,  they  would  use  the  occasion  to  capture  a  greater  market  share.  This  interplay  is doubtless a significant factor in the evident loss of pricing power in American business.\n\nIntensifying  global  competition  also  may  be  further  restraining  domestic  firms' ability to hike prices as well as wages. Clearly, the appreciation of the dollar on balance over the past  eighteen  months  or  so,  together  with  low  inflation  in  many  of  our  trading  partners,  has resulted in a marked decline in non-oil import prices that has helped to damp domestic inflation pressures. Yet it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  these  influences,  too,  would  be  holding  down inflation only temporarily; they represent a transition to a lower price level than would otherwise prevail, not to a permanently lower rate of inflation.\n\nAgainst the background of all these considerations, the FOMC has recognized the need  to  remain  vigilant  for  signs  of  potentially  inflationary  imbalances  that  might,  if  not corrected promptly, undermine our economic expansion. The FOMC in fact has signaled a state of heightened alert for possible policy tightening since last July in its policy directives. But, we have  also  taken  care  not  to  act  prematurely.  The  FOMC  refrained  from  changing  policy  last summer,  despite expectations of a near-term policy firming by many  financial  market participants.  In  light  of  the  developments  I've  just  discussed  affecting  wages  and  prices,  we thought  inflation  might  well  remain  damped,  and  in  any  case  was  unlikely  to  pick  up  very rapidly, in part because the economic expansion appeared likely to slow to a more sustainable pace. In the event, inflation has remained quiescent since then.\n\nGiven  the  lags  with  which  monetary  policy  affects  the  economy,  however,  we cannot  rule  out  a  situation  in  which  a  preemptive  policy  tightening  may  become  appropriate before any sign of actual higher inflation becomes evident. If the FOMC were to implement such an action, it would be judging that the risks to the economic expansion of waiting longer had increased unduly and had begun to outweigh the advantages of waiting for uncertainties to be reduced by the accumulation of more information about economic trends. Indeed, the hallmark of a successful policy to foster sustainable economic growth is that inflation does not rise. I find it  ironic  that  our  actions  in  1994-95  were  criticized  by  some  because  inflation  did  not  turn upward. That outcome, of course, was the intent of the tightening, and I am satisfied that our actions  then  were  both  necessary  and  effective,  and  helped  to  foster  the  continued  economic expansion.\n\nTo be sure, 1997 is not 1994. The real  federal  funds  rate  today  is  significantly higher than it was three years ago. Then we had just completed an extended period of monetary ease which addressed the credit stringencies of the early 1990s, and with the abatement of the credit  crunch,  the  low  real  funds  rate  of  early  1994  was  clearly  incompatible  with  containing inflation and sustaining growth going forward. In February 1997, in contrast, our concern is a matter of relative risks rather than of expected outcomes. The real funds rate, judging by core inflation, is only slightly below its early 1995 peak for this cycle and might be at a level that will promote  continued  non-inflationary  growth,  especially  considering  the  recent  rise  in  the exchange value of the dollar. Nonetheless, we cannot be sure. And the risks of being wrong are clearly tilted to the upside.\n\nI  wish  it  were  possible  to  lay  out  in  advance  exactly  what  conditions  have  to prevail  to  portend  a  buildup  of  inflation  pressures  or  inflationary  psychology.  However,  the circumstances that have been associated with increasing inflation in the past have not followed a\n\nsingle pattern. The processes have differed from cycle to cycle, and what may have been a useful leading indicator in one instance has given off misleading signals in another.\n\nI have already discussed the key role of labor market developments in restraining inflation  in  the  current  cycle  and  our  careful  monitoring  of  signs  that  the  transition  phase  of trading off lower real wages for greater job security might be coming to a close. As always, with resource utilization rates high, we would need to watch closely a situation in which demand was clearly unsustainable because it was producing escalating pressures on resources, which could destabilize the economy. And we would need to be watchful that the progress we have made in keeping  inflation  expectations  damped  was  not  eroding.  In  general,  though,  our  analysis  will need  to  encompass  all  potentially  relevant  information,  from  financial  markets  as  well  as  the economy, especially when some signals, like those in the labor market, have not been following their established patterns.\n\nThe ongoing economic expansion to date has reinforced our conviction about the importance  of  low  inflation  --  and  the  public's  confidence  in  continued  low  inflation.  The economic expansion almost surely would not have  lasted  nearly  so  long  had  monetary  policy supported  an  unsustainable  acceleration  of  spending  that  induced  a  buildup  of  inflationary imbalances. The Federal Reserve must not acquiesce in an upcreep in inflation, for acceding to higher  inflation  would  countenance  an  insidious  weakening  of  our  chances  for  sustaining long-run  economic  growth.  Inflation  interferes  with  the  efficient  allocation  of  resources  by confusing price signals, undercutting a focus on the longer run, and distorting incentives.\n\nThis year overall inflation is anticipated to stay restrained. The central tendency of the forecasts made by the Board members and Reserve Bank presidents has the increase in the total CPI slipping back into a range of 2¾ to 3 percent over the four quarters of the year. This slight falloff from last year's pace is expected to owe in part to a slower rise in food prices as some of last year's supply limitations ease. More importantly, world oil supplies are projected by most analysts to increase relative to world oil demand, and futures markets project a further decline in prices, at least in the near term. The recent and prospective declines in crude oil prices not  only  should  affect  retail  gasoline  and  home  heating  oil  prices  but  also  should  relieve inflation pressures through lower prices for other petroleum products, which are imbedded in the economy's underlying cost structure. Nonetheless, the trend in inflation rates in the core CPI and in  broader  price  measures  may  be  somewhat  less  favorable  than  in  recent  years.  A  continued tight labor market, whose influence on costs would be augmented by the scheduled increase in the  minimum  wage  later  in  the  year  and  perhaps  by  higher  growth  of  benefits  now  that considerable health-care savings already have been realized, could put upward pressure on core inflation. Moreover, the effects of the sharp rise in the dollar over the last eighteen months in pushing down import prices are likely to ebb over coming quarters.\n\nThe  unemployment  rate,  according  to  Board  members  and  Bank  presidents, should stay around 5¼ to 5½ percent through the fourth quarter, consistent with their projections of  measured  real  GDP  growth  of  2  to  2¼  percent  over  the  four  quarters  of  the  year.  Such  a growth rate would represent some downshifting in output expansion from that of last year. The projected  moderation  of  growth  likely  would  reflect  several  influences:  (1)  declines  in  real federal  government  purchases  should  be  exerting  a  modest  degree  of  restraint  on  overall demand;  (2)  the  lagged  effects  of  the  increase  in  the  exchange  value  of  the  dollar  in  recent months likely will damp U.S. net exports somewhat this year; and (3) residential construction is unlikely to repeat the gains of 1996. On the other hand, we do not see evidence of widespread imbalances either in business inventories or in stocks of equipment and consumer durables that would  lead  to  a  substantial  cutback  in  spending.  And  financial  conditions  overall  remain\n\nsupportive; real interest rates are not high by historical standards and credit is readily available from intermediaries and in the market.\n\nThe  usual  uncertainties  in  the  overall  outlook  are  especially  focused  on  the behavior of  consumers.  Consumption  should  rise  roughly  in  line  with  the  projected  moderate expansion of disposable income, but both upside and downside risks are present. According to various surveys, sentiment is decidedly upbeat. Consumers have enjoyed healthy gains in their real incomes along with the extraordinary stock-market driven rise in their financial wealth over the last couple of years. Indeed, econometric models suggest that the more than $4 trillion rise in equity values since late 1994 should have had a larger positive influence on consumer spending than seems to have actually occurred.\n\nIt  is  possible,  however,  that  households  have  been  reluctant  to  spend  much  of their added wealth because they see a greater need to keep it to support spending in retirement. Many households have expressed heightened concern about their financial security in old age, which reportedly has led to increased provision for retirement. The results of a survey conducted annually by the Roper Organization, which asks individuals about their confidence in the Social Security system, shows that between 1992 and 1996 the percent of respondents expressing little or no confidence in the system jumped from about 45 percent to more than 60 percent.\n\nMoreover,  consumer  debt  burdens  are  near  historical  highs,  while  credit  card delinquencies and personal bankruptcies have risen sharply over the past year.  These circumstances may make both borrowers and lenders a bit more cautious, damping spending. In fact, we may be seeing both wealth and debt effects already at work for different segments of the population, to an approximately offsetting extent. Saving out of current income by households in the  upper  income  quintile,  who  own  nearly  three-fourths  of  all  non-pension  equities  held  by households,  evidently  has  declined  in  recent  years.  At  the  same  time,  the  use  of  credit  for purchases appears to have leveled off after a sharp runup from 1993 to 1996, perhaps because some households are becoming debt constrained and, as a result, are curtailing their spending.\n\nThe  Federal  Reserve  will  be  weighing  these  influences  as  it  endeavors  to  help extend the current period of sustained growth. Participants in financial markets seem to believe that  in  the  current  benign  environment  the  FOMC  will  succeed  indefinitely.  There  is  no evidence, however, that the business cycle has been repealed. Another recession will doubtless occur some day owing to  circumstances  that  could  not  be,  or  at  least  were  not,  perceived  by policymakers and financial market participants alike. History demonstrates that participants in financial  markets  are  susceptible  to  waves  of  optimism,  which  can  in  turn  foster  a  general process  of  asset-price  inflation  that  can  feed  through  into  markets  for  goods  and  services. Excessive optimism sows the seeds of its own reversal in the form of imbalances that tend to grow over time. When unwarranted expectations ultimately are not realized, the unwinding of these financial excesses can act to amplify a downturn in economic activity, much as they can amplify the upswing. As you know, last December I put the question this way: '...how do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions ...?'\n\nWe have not been able, as yet, to provide a satisfying answer to this question, but there are reasons in the current environment to keep this question on the table. Clearly, when people are exposed to long periods of relative economic tranquility, they seem inevitably prone to complacency about the future. This is understandable. We have had fifteen years of economic expansion interrupted by only one recession -- and that was six years ago. As the memory of such past events fades, it naturally seems ever less sensible to keep up one's guard against an\n\nadverse event in the future. Thus, it should come as no surprise that, after such a long period of balanced expansion, risk premiums for advancing funds to businesses in virtually all financial markets have declined to near-record lows.\n\nIs it possible that there is something fundamentally new about this current period that  would  warrant  such  complacency?  Yes,  it  is  possible.  Markets  may  have  become  more efficient,  competition  is  more  global,  and  information  technology  has  doubtless  enhanced  the stability  of  business  operations.  But,  regrettably,  history  is  strewn  with  visions  of  such  'new eras' that, in the end, have proven to be a mirage. In short, history counsels caution.\n\nSuch caution seems especially warranted with regard to the sharp rise in equity prices during the past two years. These gains have obviously raised questions of sustainability. Analytically,  current  stock-price  valuations  at  prevailing  long-term  interest  rates  could  be justified by very strong earnings growth expectations. In fact, the long-term earnings projections of financial analysts have been marked up noticeably over the last year and seem to imply very high  earnings  growth  and  continued  rising  profit  margins,  at  a  time  when  such  margins  are already up appreciably from their depressed levels of  five  years  ago.  It  could  be  argued  that, although margins are the highest in a generation, they are still below those that prevailed in the 1960s.  Nonetheless,  further  increases  in  these  margins  would  evidently  require  continued restraint  on  costs:  labor  compensation  continuing  to  grow  at  its  current  pace  and  productivity growth picking up. Neither, of course, can be ruled out. But we should keep in  mind  that,  at these relatively low long-term interest rates,  small  changes  in  long-term  earnings  expectations could have outsized impacts on equity prices.\n\nCaution also seems warranted by the narrow yield spreads that suggest perceptions  of  low  risk,  possibly  unrealistically  low  risk.  Considerable  optimism  about  the ability  of  businesses  to  sustain  this  current  healthy  financial  condition  seems,  as  I  indicated earlier,  to  be  influencing  the  setting  of  risk  premiums,  not  just  in  the  stock  market  but throughout the financial system. This optimistic attitude has become especially evident in quality spreads on high-yield corporate bonds -- what we used to call 'junk bonds.' In addition, banks have continued to ease terms and standards on business loans, and margins on  many  of  these loans are now quite thin. Many banks are pulling back a little from consumer credit card lending as  losses  exceed  expectations.  Nonetheless,  some  bank  and  nonbank  lenders  have  been expanding aggressively into the home equity loan market and so-called 'subprime' auto lending, although recent problems in the latter may already be introducing a sense of caution.\n\nWhy  should  the  central  bank  be  concerned  about  the  possibility  that  financial markets may be overestimating returns or mispricing risk? It is not that we have a firm view that equity prices are necessarily excessive right now or risk spreads patently too low. Our goal is to contribute as best we can to the highest possible growth of income and wealth over time, and we would be pleased if the favorable economic environment projected in markets actually comes to pass. Rather, the FOMC has to be sensitive to indications of even slowly building imbalances, whatever their source, that, by fostering the emergence of inflation pressures, would ultimately threaten healthy economic expansion.\n\nUnfortunately,  because  the  monetary  aggregates  were  subject  to  an  episode  of aberrant  behavioral  patterns  in  the  early  1990s,  they  are  likely  to  be  of  only  limited  help  in making this judgment. For three decades starting in the early 1960s, the public's demand for the broader  monetary  aggregates,  especially  M2,  was  reasonably  predictable.  In  the  intermediate term, M2 velocity -- nominal income divided by the stock of M2 -- tended to vary directly with the  difference  between  money  market  yields  and  the  return  on  M2  assets  --  that  is,  with  its\n\nshort-term  opportunity  cost.  In  the  long  run,  as  adjustments  in  deposit  rates  caused  the opportunity cost to revert to an equilibrium, M2 velocity also tended to return to an associated stable equilibrium level. For several years in the early 1990s, however, the velocities of M2 and M3 exhibited persisting upward shifts that departed markedly from these historical patterns.\n\nIn  the  last  two  to  three  years,  velocity  patterns  seem  to  have  returned  to  those historical relationships, after allowing  for  a  presumed  permanent  upward  shift  in  the  levels  of velocity. Even so, given the abnormal velocity behavior during the early 1990s, FOMC members continue to see considerable uncertainty in the relationship of broad money to opportunity costs and nominal income. Concern about the possibility of aberrant behavior has made the FOMC hesitant to upgrade the role of these measures in monetary policy.\n\nAgainst  this  background,  at  its  February  meeting,  the  FOMC  reaffirmed  the provisional ranges set last July for money and debt growth this year: 1 to 5 percent for M2, 2 to 6 percent for M3, and 3 to 7 percent for the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors. The M2 and M3 ranges again are designed to be consistent with the FOMC's long-run goal of price stability: For, if the velocities of the broader monetary aggregates were to continue behaving as they did before 1990, then money growth around the middle portions of the ranges would be consistent with  noninflationary,  sustainable  economic  expansion.  But,  even  with  such  velocity  behavior this  year,  when  inflation  is  expected  to  still  be  higher  than  is  consistent  with  our  long-run objective of reasonable price stability, the broader aggregates could well grow around the upper bounds of these ranges. The debt aggregate probably will expand around the middle of its range this year.\n\nI  will  conclude  on  the  same  upbeat  note  about  the  U.S.  economy  with  which  I began.  Although  a  central  banker's  occupational  responsibility  is  to  stay  on  the  lookout  for trouble,  even  I  must  admit  that  our  economic  prospects  in  general  are  quite  favorable.  The flexibility of our market system and the vibrancy of our private sector remain examples for the whole world to emulate. The Federal Reserve will endeavor to do its part by continuing to foster a monetary framework under which our citizens can prosper to the fullest possible extent.\n\nBIS Review   22/1997",

In recent years, however, a number  of  financial  institutions  have  come  to  focus  on  disclosure  of  a  wider  range  of information, including their management policies. This is partly attributable to the expansion of derivatives transactions, which has made risk management techniques increasingly important in the management of financial institutions, and which has thereby encouraged financial institutions to improve such techniques. Accordingly, individual financial institutions have been motivated to  reveal  voluntarily  their  risk  exposures  and  risk  management  methods  in  order  to  win  a favorable  assessment  from  market  participants.  Disclosure  thus  brings  into  play  a  check mechanism inherent in financial markets (hereafter referred to as the market check mechanism) that disciplines management of financial institutions, and thereby helps to enhance the efficiency and transparency of the markets and to stabilize the financial system.\n\nThis report examines the disclosure of information on risks of financial institutions, with an overview of the current practices and future issues. It is intended to serve market participants, the beneficiaries of the information disclosed.\n\nBIS Review   25/1997",

         "Mr. Matsushita discusses payment and settlement systems with regard to current issues in Japan Speech by the Governor of the Bank of Japan, Mr. Yasuo Matsushita, held at the Japan Center for Economic Research on 28/2/97.\n\n## L Introduction\n\nI am greatly honored to have been invited by the Japan Center for Economic Research to address this distinguished audience. I wish to take this opportunity to first briefly discuss the recent monetary and economic conditions, and then address the current issues regarding the payment and settlement systems in Japan.\n\nThere have not been many opportunities to discuss payment and settlement on occasions such as this, despite the fact that they are important to all the economic activities of households and firms, and that as a central bank, we are very much involved in the developments in this area. I have not addressed this area partly due to its technical nature, but recently several developments have attracted much attention to the payment and settlement issues in Japan, as in other countries: specifically, pilot projects of electronic money products and the Bank's plans to abolish the designated-time settlement mode to make real-time gross settlement the only way of settlement on the Bank of Japan Financial Network System (BOJ-NET).\n\nThe role of the central bank in ensuring a smooth and stable operation of payment and settlement systems has become clearly recognized through the deliberations on the revision of the Bank of Japan Law that have been taking place since last year. The \"Report on the Revision of the Bank of Japan Law,\" released recently by the Financial System Research Council, an advisory committee to the Minister of Finance, states one of the objectives of the Bank of Japan to be \"to ensure smooth fund settlement among financial institutions, thereby contributing to the maintenance of an orderly financial system.\"\n\nI wish therefore to discuss today the current issues regarding the payment and settlement systems in Japan and also refer to the role of the central bank in those systems, bearing in mind the domestic and overseas trend in these areas.\n\n## II. Domestic Monetary and Economic Conditions\n\nI would like to start by reviewing the recent economic condition and the thinking behind the Bank's current monetary policy management.\n\nWith regard to the domestic economic condition, the Bank of Japan judges that a moderate economic recovery continues and that the recovery is gradually becoming firmer.\n\nA notable change in the economic condition since the latter half of 1996 is that the decline in external demand, which had been a factor constraining the economic recovery, halted in autumn 1996 following the depreciation of the yen. Recently there has been an upward trend in external demand. In addition, inventory adjustment in some raw materials and semiconductor industries had almost reached completion by the end of 1996. As a result, production has started to grow at an accelerating pace, reflecting fully the increase in final demand. Personal consumption continues to grow moderately but steadily, supported by the buoyant sales of passenger cars, and the recovery in business fixed investment is spreading to a wider range of industries and to smaller firms than previously observed, reflecting improvements in corporate sales and profits.\n\nIt should be borne in mind that increase in demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate scheduled for fiscal 1997 is contributing to the recent improvement in economic indicators, as in housing investment, and these improvements need to be seen in this light. However, despite a gradual decrease in public-sector investment from the latter half of 1996, the virtuous circle -in which increased production leads to a recovery in business fixed investment and personal consumption through improved corporate profits and employment income -is gradually becoming more apparent. This improvement is encouraging.\n\nIn contrast to these recent improvements in economic indicators, the beginning of the year saw a significant fall in stock prices and this, together with the decline in long-term interest rates in the financial markets, indicates that the confidence of the market participants in the economic outlook is still slow to improve.\n\nVarious causes can be considered for the market's uncertainty as to future developments in the economy. While the renewed concern over the nonperforming-loan problem of financial institutions may be one important factor, the strong awareness of the effects of the anticipated fiscal tightening in the next fiscal year is also significant.\n\nFrom spring to summer this year, a temporary slowdown in economic recovery seems inevitable due to a reaction to the boost in demand that is occurring ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate. However, given the strengthening of the virtuous circle, it is more likely than before that the recovery trend of the economy will be sustained. In addition, stock prices appear to have stabilized. Therefore, in considering whether the economy can overcome the effects of fiscal tightening to sustain the trend of recovery, it is important to examine macroand micro-economic data, including the economic indicators that will be released in the future, signals from financial markets, and firms' business plans for the next fiscal year.\n\nI will now turn to the environment surrounding domestic prices. The depreciation of the yen has continued since the beginning of the year, and a rise in the consumption tax rate is planned for April. The raising of the tax rate will be passed on to product prices, pushing up the price index accordingly. However, as long as the price hike does not surpass the increase caused by the raising of the consumption tax rate, the price rise will only reflect a single price adjustment, and will not indicate any fundamental change in the situation underlying prices. Therefore it would not be appropriate to formulate monetary policy to counter such superficial changes in price indexes.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of monetary policy management, that is, the viewpoint of ensuring stable economic development through price stability, the issue of concern is whether the rise in the tax rate will trigger price hikes that take advantage of the increase or will lead to inflationary expectations, which in turn might bring about price rises beyond the immediate effects of the tax rate increase. Whether such a general price increase will occur depends on various factors, including the prevailing domestic supply and demand conditions and consumer confidence. It is thus necessary to pay attention to the inflationary expectations and the possible negative developments, including overreaction by consumers, resulting from the rise in the consumption tax rate, rather than focusing attention on the superficial hikes in prices.\n\nAlthough the decline in prices began to slow from the end of 1996, there is only a limited possibility that domestic prices will take a clear upward path given that improvement in the supply and demand conditions in the domestic economy is expected to remain moderate for now. However, in view of the accelerating rise in import prices reflecting the yen's depreciation and higher crude oil prices since the latter half of 1996, together with the strengthening of the\n\nrecovery in private demand, it remains necessary to pay careful attention to the developments in domestic prices.\n\nIn the management of current monetary policy, the Bank of Japan will continue to monitor economic developments closely, placing emphasis on further strengthening the foundation of an economic recovery.\n\n## IJ. Current Issues Regarding the Payment and Settlement Systems in Japan\n\n## A. Payment and Settlement Systems in Japan\n\nI would now like to move on to the main theme of today's speech: payment and settlement systems. The expression \"payment and settlement systems\" may sound somewhat technical and may indeed be unfamiliar to you. In a market economy, however, every economic activity conducted by firms and households -be it production or consumption -is concluded with settlement. Payment and settlement systems, or mechanisms for clearing and settling payments, are therefore used directly or indirectly by every economic entity. People may not be conscious of the functions of the systems when they operate smoothly and efficiently. However, once a problem arises, great difficulties are encountered.\n\nThe means of payment used by firms and households vary from cash -that is, banknotes and coins -to checks and bills, funds transfers between bank accounts, and credit cards. When payment is made by cash, settlement is final there and then. However, when payment is made by other means such as checks or bills, the mere handing over of the checks and bills will not complete the settlement of the transaction. When a check is drawn, for example, settlement is final only when the check is collected and the stated amount of money is transferred from the deposit money in the bank account of the payer to the bank account of the payee. If such transfers are not effected between accounts for some reason, for example, there are insufficient funds in the payer's account, the transaction will remain unsettled. When the payer and the payee hold accounts at different banks, interbank settlement is needed, and settlement will be completed only after the corresponding debit and credit entries are made to the current accounts held by each bank with the Bank of Japan.\n\nAlthough various means of payment are available to firms and households, settlement is ultimately made either by a handing over of cash issued by the Bank of Japan or by a transfer of funds between bank accounts using deposit money, which are liabilities of private financial institutions. \"Money\" in a modern society therefore comprises cash and deposit money, and is reliant on the confidence of the public that bank deposits can be converted into cash at any time.\n\nWhen a large number of relatively small-value payments, such as those using checks and bills, need to be settled between banks, they are not settled one at a time between the accounts held by the banks at the Bank of Japan. Rather, payment instruments such as checks and bills are collected and exchanged at clearing houses, where the credit and debit positions of each bank are calculated, and then the net positions are settled between the BOJ accounts. This calculation process is called clearing, and is operated by private institutions. Specifically, there are three major private clearing systems in Japan: the bill and check-clearing system; the Zengin Data Telecommunications System (Zengin System) for funds transfers between bank accounts and for credit card payments; and the Foreign Exchange Yen Clearing System for yen payments arising from foreign exchange and Euro-yen transactions.\n\nBOJ accounts are used to settle the net positions resulting from various clearing systems, as well as to directly settle large-value interbank funds transactions, such as call-money transactions, which do not go through clearing processes. The value of funds transfers at the Bank of Japan totals approximately ¥300 trillion per day, which is equivalent to approximately 60 percent of Japan's annual GDP.\n\n## B. The Role of the Central Bank in Payment and Settlement Systems\n\nBank of Japan thus plays an important role in both the settlement made by cash and the settlement made by deposit money. The duty of central banks is to issue and control money -that is, to ensure the public's confidence in the holding and the using of money.\n\nTo this end, two conditions must be satisfied: (1) the value of money must be stable -that is, price stability must be maintained; and (2) the circulation of money and the functioning of payment and settlement systems must be stable and efficient. If it were not possible to use cash and deposits as desired for settlements, people would not be able to hold money with confidence. The mission of central banks, therefore, is to make the currencies they issue more convenient to use and to thereby enable firms and households to confidently engage in daily transactions and funds settlements. Bank of Japan thus plays a vital role in the settlement process in Japan as a whole.\n\nBank of Japan serves two specific functions in securing the stability and efficiency of the country's payment and settlement systems: (1) providing the means of settlement to the public; and (2) attending to the smooth execution of payments and settlements in Japan.\n\nAs a provider of the means of settlement, the Bank issues Bank of Japan notes and ensures their smooth circulation. As I mentioned earlier, cash payments immediately complete the settlement of a transaction by delivering a means of payment directly to the counterparty. This on-the-spot completion of settlement, whereby the payee is able to secure the monetary value received, is described as \"settlement with finality.\"\n\nIn order to maintain the finality of cash payments, it is essential to secure the confidence of the people in the soundness of the central bank's assets, which underpins the value of the banknotes. The Bank thus pays close attention to the soundness of its assets. Furthermore, any circulation of counterfeit notes would undermine people's confidence in holding money. To prevent such an occurrence, the Bank examines the authenticity of the large volumes of banknotes that are returned to the Bank of Japan every day from financial institutions. Careful attention is also paid to the cleanness of each of the banknotes in circulation. The Bank also exerts itself to the utmost to improve anti-counterfeiting measures, and has recently been engaged in joint research with overseas central banks on the prevention of banknote counterfeiting using color copiers. Through such efforts, the Bank aims to preclude the circulation of counterfeits.\n\nThe Bank also provides current accounts at the Bank as another means of settlement. The Bank offers accounts to private financial institutions, and the funds in these accounts, or deposit money, are equivalent to banknotes in their function as a means of settlement with finality. In order to improve the safety and efficiency of settlements using these BOJ accounts, the Bank has made various efforts, including the introduction of the BOJ-NET -the Bank of Japan Financial Network System, which is an on-line system for funds transfers among the current accounts held by private financial institutions with the Bank of Japan. The\n\nBank intends to further improve the system in cooperation with those concerned by making realtime gross settlement the only settlement mode, which I shall discuss in detail later.\n\nThe second function of the Bank of Japan with regard to the payment and settlement systems is to attend to the safety and efficiency of payments and settlements in Japan, and to provide adequate liquidity when necessary. As I mentioned earlier, the important tasks of the Bank include ensuring a smooth supply of banknotes throughout the country, and monitoring the stability of daily settlements across the BOJ accounts.\n\nIn addition, the Bank, in coordination with the operators of the private clearing systems such as the bill and check clearing, plays an important role in preventing any troubles in the systems or participants from jeopardizing the entire payment and settlement systems in Japan. In any settlement system, there is the risk that a failure of one bank to meet its obligations will trigger a chain reaction of defaults, eventually paralyzing the entire system. In addition, both payment and settlement systems and individual banks constituting the systems are supported by the market's confidence. As this confidence is in large part a psychological factor, a failure of a single bank could lead to a run on deposits at other banks. Such risk is referred to as systemic risk. Materialization of systemic risk will disrupt not only settlements between banks but also those between firms and households, having a profound impact on the economy and on the society as a whole. Such systemic risk inherent in the network of settlements is what differentiates the banking sector from other industrial sectors.\n\nThe role of the central bank is to constantly monitor the institutional framework and the operation of payment and settlement systems, working in coordination with the parties concerned to thereby prevent the materialization of systemic risk. The central bank must also ensure that the system can be provided the funds to break the chain reaction of defaults should some emergency occur. Another important task of the central bank is to attend to the soundness of the private financial institutions, which are the participants in the payment and settlement systems and which settle the payments between firms and households. To summarize these roles, an important mission of the central bank is to maintain the safety and efficiency of the entire settlement process, a process which involves (1) private financial institutions which accept the deposits of firms and households; (2) private clearing organizations processing interbank payments; and (3) the central bank which discharges interbank settlement obligations resulting from private-sector clearing systems.\n\n## C. Measures to Improve the Safety of Payment and Settlement Systems\n\nPayment and settlement systems have not necessarily been an issue of public interest reflecting the general perception that these systems are mechanical processing units for discharging obligations by inputting transaction data. The fact that there had been no financial institution failures until recently and that payments have been settled safely may have supported this perception. However, financial institutions have actually failed and the speed at which systemic risk is transmitted within and beyond international borders has increased significantly owing to technological innovations in finance and telecommunications, and financial globalization. Under these circumstances, it is inappropriate to view payment and settlement systems as merely mechanical processing units. These systems must be resilient against systemic risk, and the establishing of such systems is an extremely important challenge for both the private financial institutions and for the central bank. It becomes apparent that various incidents and studies have raised the awareness of the need to improve the safety of payment and settlement systems among private financial institutions and central banks both in Japan and abroad.\n\nIn various countries, new safety standards have been applied to private clearing systems. These standards include limits on each participant's net debit position and collateral requirements to ensure the provision of adequate backup liquidity in the event of an inability to settle by the participant having the largest single net-debit position. These standards were devised by the central banks of the Group of Ten countries as minimum standards to be satisfied by cross-border and multi-currency netting schemes, and are referred to as the Lamfalussy standards, after the chairman of the committee on this study. As these standards can apply to domestic clearing systems, they are being used recently in many countries as guidelines for improving the integrity of private clearing systems.\n\nIn Japan, it has recently been decided to enhance the safety measures of the Foreign Exchange Yen Clearing System so as to satisfy the Lamfalussy standards. The Bank will continue to actively support the initiatives to improve the safety of the payment and settlement systems.\n\nD. Improving the Safety of the Central Bank's Settlement System -Real-Time Gross Settlement\n\nThe need to improve safety applies not only to private clearing systems but also to the settlement systems operated by central banks. In this regard, an increasing number of central banks have been adopting real-time gross settlement for current account settlements at the central bank. Real-time gross settlement -called RTGS for short -is a system in which the central bank processes and effects every payment instruction sent by private financial institutions in real time and on an order-by-order basis.\n\nMost central banks, including the Bank of Japan, have typically conducted interbank settlements on a designated-time basis rather than by RTGS. In the conventional designated-time settlement, payment instructions are accumulated until designated settlement times instead of each one being settled immediately. At the designated time -at present, 9 a.m., 1 p.m., 3 p.m., and 5 p.m. in Japan -the net settlement position of each financial institution is computed and its account is credited or debited simultaneously.\n\nIn designated-time settlement, financial institutions need only the funds equivalent to their net debit positions at the time of settlement, and thus, it is an efficient system from the viewpoint of fund management. However, if a single financial institution in the system were to fail to meet its obligations, all payments would inevitably be suspended, in order that all the payment instructions sent or received by that financial institution could be revoked to recompute the settlement obligations of each financial institution. In addition, such failure could create a shortage of funds at the financial institutions which had planned to make payments with the funds they had expected to receive from the failed financial institution. This may lead to a series of liquidity shortages or defaults -that is, the materialization of systemic risk. The effects of this risk could be grave, considering that the amount of funds handled by the central bank's settlement system is substantial.\n\nWith RTGS, the smooth execution of settlements solely depends on the ability of the parties concerned to meet their obligations, as every payment instruction is processed in real time on an order-by-order basis. Therefore, even if a bank were to suddenly become unable to settle, disruption to the system would be limited: suspension of the operation of the entire settlement system, which can occur under designated-time settlement, can be avoided. The\n\nintroduction of RTGS in many countries around the world, including some Asian countries, is a result of the efforts of central banks to improve their settlement systems to contain systemic risk.\n\nAgainst this background, the Bank of Japan also decided at the end of 1996 to make RTGS the only mode of settlement via BOJ accounts. Specifically, by the end of the year 2000, the Bank plans to abolish designated-time settlement and make all funds transfers on the basis of RTGS. This may require market participants to establish new transaction and settlement practices. To ensure the smooth operation of RTGS, the Bank intends to directly supply intraday liquidity, which is indispensable for smooth settlements, to cover liquidity shortages that might arise in the system despite the efforts of participant financial institutions.\n\nLast December, the Bank announced its policy to realize RTGS as the only settlement mode on the BOJ-NET with some specific proposals for design features and requested comments from the public. The Bank was fortunate to receive many valuable comments and recognized the increasing awareness of settlement risk among market participants. The Bank believes that it has been able to gain strong support from the private financial institutions for RTGS, and plans to publish in the near future its policies along with the comments received. The Bank strongly hopes to receive constructive opinions and suggestions in deciding the details of the design of the system. The Bank will also solicit views from a broad range of market participants whenever making a major change in the operation of the Bank's settlement system, as a change in the system could have a significant impact on the market practices and the daily business of the financial institutions participating in the system.\n\nIt should be noted that realization of RTGS does not necessarily mean the elimination of all the risks in payment and settlement systems. Moreover, RTGS on the BOJNET will produce the desired effects only when the safety of the private clearing systems connected to the Bank's system is ensured. To illustrate this point, suppose that the private financial institutions, for some reason, switched from direct settlements via BOJ accounts to indirect settlements using private clearing systems given the introduction of RTGS. The total amount of risks in the payment and settlement systems as a whole would not decrease if there were inadequate management of risks in the private systems. In this respect, it is indispensable for the private financial institutions, the private clearing organizations, and the central bank to work together to enhance the efficiency and safety of the payment and settlement systems in Japan.\n\nSuch efforts of the private sector and the central bank to improve the infrastructure for settlements will also contribute to the strengthening of the global competitiveness of Japan's financial markets, which is indeed the aim of the Japanese \"Big Bang\" deregulation package proposed by Prime Minister Hashimoto.\n\n## E. Improvement in Securities Settlement Systems\n\nIn addition to the safety of funds settlements, much attention has been paid globally to the safety of settlements of securities such as government securities and stocks.\n\nAlthough I do not have enough time today to discuss this issue in detail, the established guidelines for risk management in securities settlements are the recommendations set out in 1989 by the Group of Thirty, an international group of experts in finance.\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations, significant progress has been made recently in Japan toward improving the settlement systems for securities. For the settlement of\n\nJapanese government securities (JGS), for example, an on-line network and delivery-versuspayment system have been established. Delivery versus payment, known as DVP, is a mechanism which links the delivery of JGS with the corresponding funds transfer so that both are executed simultaneously. In such a way, a failure to collect payments or receive securities can be avoided. In addition, rolling settlement was introduced in October 1996. Here, settlements are made on every business day for the contracts that were agreed on a specific number of business days previous to that settlement date (currently seven days). This replaces the prior arrangement where contracts made over a certain period were accumulated before they were settled on one of the six designated settlement days of each month (the 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th, and the last day of the month). The system will be improved further in April 1997 to complete settlement on the third business day after the date of contract.\n\nRegarding settlement of corporate bonds, which may be familiar to many of you here, delivery of bonds has conventionally been made by a document called registration certificate and the corresponding payment has been settled separately through clearing of bills. At the end of 1997, however, on-line delivery of corporate bonds will be brought into effect. A delivery-versus-payment service is also envisioned for the future by connecting the settlement system for corporate bonds with the BOJ-NET.\n\nVarious efforts are thus under way in Japan to enhance the safety of securities settlements. However, much remains to be improved. A large volume of stocks and other securities continues to be delivered physically, and DVP systems are yet to be established for such securities. Furthermore, the lag between the contract and the settlement, that is, the final transfers of securities and funds, needs to be shortened for various securities. In this respect, the Bank intends to contribute actively and expects further efforts on the part of the private sector.\n\n## F. Developments in Electronic Money\n\nI would now like to briefly discuss the developments in electronic money, which might become a popular means of settlement in the future.\n\nThe term electronic money is used to refer to payment mechanisms in which electronic records of funds are stored in devices such as IC cards -with microprocessor chip (integrated circuits) embedded -or in computer networks and then transferred safely from one customer to another. Many pilot projects are under way in various countries, making use of the recent technological innovations in IC cards and computer networks as well as in such security features as encryption. In Japan as well, financial institutions and firms have begun various projects individually or jointly. For example, some banks are individually using IC-card based electronic money on trial within certain buildings in Tokyo. A joint project by a credit card company and several banks on card-based electronic money is also being planned for summer 1998 in a certain area of Tokyo. It is said to be of the largest one of its kind in the world, involving approximately 1,000 stores and 100,000 cards.\n\nWhen electronic money products become prevalent, they may be used as new means of settlement replacing cash and deposits. People may settle various retail transactions by transferring the electronic values between IC cards or on networks instead of banknotes and coins. To prepare for this possibility, central banks are keenly interested in the soundness and the implications of electronic money developments. From this viewpoint, the central banks of the Group of Ten countries have been studying various aspects of electronic money: security features to prevent fraud and counterfeiting, implications for the effectiveness of the central bank's monetary policy, and the stability of payment and settlement systems.\n\nAt present, however, it is very difficult to project how electronic money technology will develop, to what extent electronic money products will be used by the public as a substitute for cash or deposit money, and at what pace these developments will proceed. The pace of the developments will depend on how the reliability of electronic money products is secured and how conveniently these products are utilized. Under these circumstances, it is not easy to reach a verdict on the various relevant issues, nor would it be appropriate to jump to conclusions. Developers and operators of electronic money schemes can be expected to exercise ingenuity on such aspects as security and legal matters, and the innovative capabilities of the private sector should not be discouraged. The basic stance that the Bank should maintain at present is to be flexible to the various possibilities concerning the future course of development in electronic money.\n\nRegarding the implications of the development of electronic money on monetary policy, monetary policy will, in theory, continue to be effective, provided that the situation does not become one where electronic money extensively substitutes not only for cash as a means of retail payment but also for deposit money for large-value transfers. Although the spread of electronic money products might affect the stability of monetary indicators, this will be adequately managed by identifying the amount outstanding of electronic money issued and by devising monetary policy management. Therefore, I wish to state that the Bank of Japan does not intend to put a brake on the development and introduction of electronic money in consideration of its effects on monetary policy.\n\nMaintaining this stance, the Bank intends to continue research on electronic money while observing the developments in the private sector in Japan and abroad. It will release the results of the research, as it has done in the past, wishing to support the efforts of the private sector.\n\n## G. The Necessity of Risk Management by Individual Financial Institutions\n\nI have so far discussed the developments regarding payment and settlement systems to contain systemic risk. It is obvious, however, that establishing an appropriate system structure alone is not enough to secure the safety of the systems. It is also important for the system participants, or individual financial institutions, to improve risk control measures by establishing a system for identifying and managing settlement risk.\n\nIn a modern society, monetary systems, as mentioned earlier, are based on the public's confidence in: (1) cash issued by the central bank; and (2) deposit money offered by private financial institutions. In order for monetary systems to function smoothly, it is necessary for the financial system as a whole to function with stability and, to that end, financial institutions themselves need to be responsible for securing sound management, including management of settlement risk.\n\nIt is evident that financial institutions should manage their risks rigorously. Compared to credit and interest rate risks, settlement risk tends to cause greater losses and disruptions once it materializes, and yet they are difficult to identify and manage. In fact, settlement risk constantly fluctuates significantly, and thus identification and management of the risk require comprehensive understanding of technical details related to processing. For example, it is necessary to know how the payment and settlement systems of different currencies work, and what risks arise from time lags. Such information and skills cannot be acquired overnight. However, in view of the impact settlement risk could have on financial institutions, it\n\nis indispensable to establish a system which makes possible the identification and measurement of settlement risk and the immediate reduction of risk following decisions by the management.\n\nI would like to emphasize that a financial institution equipped with an efficient risk management system will be able to acquire new business opportunities in the area of payment and settlement services. In fact, many European and U.S. financial institutions are creating and offering new business out of settlement operations. They are putting in large amounts of resources to establish adequate internal risk management, and are developing safe and efficient settlement services to provide to financial institutions and other customers. The fact that such operations are viable as business is an indication that European and U.S. financial institutions and firms actively use new innovative payment and settlement services to realize safe and efficient settlements.\n\n## IV. Conclusion\n\nIn summarizing today's discussion on payment and settlement systems, I would like to address the basic issues from a somewhat different point of view.\n\nFirstly, payment and settlement systems play an extremely important role in the economy as an infrastructure supporting all economic activities, although this is rarely acknowledged in our daily lives. When firms purchase raw materials and sell products, or when households receive wages and salaries, purchase goods, and remit money, all these activities are based on the assumption that payments and settlements of money are effected smoothly -in a manner that people would not even be conscious of it. To satisfy this requirement, modern society has developed a complex and precise mechanism comprising the central bank and the private sector. The expressions \"financial institutions\" and \"financial system\" may generally bring to mind the function of intermediating savings and investment through the borrowing and lending of money. Providing safe and efficient settlement services, however, is an equally important function that the central bank and the private financial institutions serve.\n\nSecondly, efforts to further improve the utility and safety of the settlement systems are becoming all the more important as economic transactions become increasingly complex and globalized and as technological innovations in finance including the payment and settlement systems progress. The Lamfalussy standards, RTGS, and the recommendations of the Group of Thirty are indeed part of such efforts.\n\nAs technology continues to progress, however, there is no final goal for the development of payment and settlement systems. In addition, financial globalization is intensifying cross-border linkages, with settlement troubles in one country affecting the settlement systems of other countries. It is therefore important for the private sector and central banks to work together to improve the payment and settlement systems by reviewing the safety standards as necessary from a global perspective. We at the Bank of Japan shall continue our efforts to enhance the safety and efficiency of the BOJ-NET, and shall support the efforts of the private sector to improve their systems.\n\nThirdly, it is important to ensure the soundness of the financial system in a broader sense. As I mentioned repeatedly, the functioning of modern monetary systems has its foundations in the public's confidence in the central bank and the private financial institutions. In order for monetary systems to function properly, the entire financial system needs to operate with stability. Sound management founded on the responsibility of the financial institutions is fundamental in establishing the confidence in private financial institutions. It is necessary for\n\nthe central bank to function as the lender of last resort should a trouble which emerged in one part of the settlement system be anticipated to spread throughout the entire system -although it is important to contain such risks in advance, sometimes it may unfortunately become impossible to prevent an incident from having impact on the entire system -so that people's everyday lives will not be seriously affected. In order to prevent the materialization of systemic risk, it is essential for the central bank to assess, through regular on-site examinations and daily monitoring, whether the soundness of individual financial institutions is secured, whether there is excessive concentration of risks in the financial system as a whole, and whether the series of transactions between financial institutions is being settled smoothly.\n\nIn summary, payment and settlement systems are vital to every economic entity including the firms and individuals represented here. As the central bank, one of whose missions is to secure the soundness of the financial system, the Bank of Japan will continue its efforts to improve the safety and efficiency of Japan's payment and settlement systems. In this regard, your suggestions and comments will be extremely valuable.\n\nThank you very much for your kind attention.\n\nThis article is excerpted and translated from a speech given by Yasuo Matsushita, Governor of the Bank of Japan, to the Japan Center for Economic Research in Tokyo on February 28, 1997.",
