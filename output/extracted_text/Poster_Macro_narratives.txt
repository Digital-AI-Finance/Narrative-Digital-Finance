Strategic Narratives during Economic Turning Points: An AI Framework for Monitoring U.S.
Central Bank Communications

Background
Examining how the Federal Reserve System communicates during times of
macroeconomic change is key to understanding policy strategy. While prior work
has studied macro indicators [3, 2] or central bank speeches [1, 4] in isolation
for this purpose, little is known about the key strategic communication patterns
occurring in times of structural economic changes.
This project bridges quantitative macroeconomic trends and qualitative commu-
nication patterns to uncover patterns in U.S. central bankers narratives during
changing economic conditions.
Research Objectives
▶Construct a transparent and data-driven composite index that condenses
multifaceted U.S. macroeconomic indicators.
▶Detect structural breaks in the macroeconomic environment through
unsupervised change point detection.
▶Quantify how the thematic focus, sentiment orientation, and rhetorical
structure of Federal Reserve communication evolves around these
macroeconomic transitions.
▶Demonstrate that combining macroeconomic signal detection with
narrative analysis offers a practical tool for interpreting monetary policy
shifts, with direct applications in market monitoring and economic
storytelling.
Methodology
Macroeconomic Index Construction
A static Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [5] is applied to six standard-
ized (12-month rolling window Z-score) monthly U.S. macroeconomic indicators
(FED Funds Rate, CPI, PPI, GDP, Unemployment, Nonfarm Payrolls from St.
Louis FED FRED datasets) from 1996 to 2025. The first principal component
(explaining the largest share of variance, see fig. 1) is interpreted as the US
Macro Strength Index, capturing joint dynamics in growth, inflation, and labor
conditions. Change points are then identified using the PELT algorithm from the
ruptures. Python library, with a radial basis function cost and penalty = 5 (see
fig. 2).
Narrative Shift Analysis
As a case study, we focus on the 2008 financial crisis. Federal Reserve bankers
speech transcripts (BIS Gigando datasets) from 2004-01-01 to 2010-04-01 are
split at the detected breakpoint (2007-05-01). BERTopic is fit on the pre-break
period and updated (partial fit) on the post-break period. For each topic, we
compute: Mean polarity shift (FinBERT sentiment [6]), semantic topic centroid
drift, cosine similarity between topic centroids, and Jaccard similarity of Maximal
Marginal Relevance (MMR) keyword sets. We also generate word clouds aggre-
gating MMR keywords from all topics before and after the breakpoint, visualizing
the thematic drift across narrative regimes (fig 3 and 4).
Null Hypothesis Testing
To test statistical significance, we simulate 1000 null scenarios by randomly shuf-
fling speech dates while preserving content and structure. Each metric is re-
computed for the randomized assignments, allowing comparison of observed drift
values to their null distributions (see fig. 5, 6, 7, and 8).

Conclusion
We apply our method to the 2008 crisis as a case study, showing that the PCA-
based Macro Strength Index captures structural shifts in the U.S. economy: the
dot-com bubble (2001), economy recovering (2004), the Subprime crisis and its
recovering phase (2007 and 2010), the post-2016 monetary regime shift, COVID-
19 (2020–2021), and recent inflation-driven turbulence (2023). Clear changes in
narrative framing emerge around the detected breakpoint:
▶Word clouds reveal a shift from growth-oriented language to crisis and
uncertainty themes.
▶Narrative drift is statistically significant across polarity, semantic centroids,
cosine similarity, and Jaccard overlap.
▶These changes align with macroeconomic dynamics and are not explained
by chance (validated via permutation tests).
This confirms the joint relevance of the Macro Strength Index and the text
analysis pipeline. The framework can be replicated across other macroeconomic
turning points to further explore strategic communication shifts in central bank
narratives.
Discussion and Further Work
While our analysis already demonstrate significant results, there are areas for
improvement. The PCA-based Macro Strength Index, while interpretable, may
obscure regime-specific dynamics due to its linear nature and fixed component
structure. Incorporating non-linear dimensionality reduction or regime-switching
models could yield more adaptive representations.
On the NLP side, while Transformer embeddings capture nuanced semantic
changes, relying on proprietary LLM services (e.g., OpenAI) limits interpretabil-
ity. A key next step is to compare performance across open-source models and
other proprietary services (e.g., FinBERT, Llama, Mistral, Google’s models) and
evaluate trade-offs between computation time, cost, explainability, and narrative
signal quality.
Future work include applying the pipeline across other detected economic shifts.
It should also validate whether narrative shifts predict market reactions or volatil-
ity, strengthening the framework’s value for policy monitoring and financial
decision-making. Extending the framework cross-country and including emerging
market central banks would also test robustness across institutional contexts.
