Abstract
This paper presents an advanced conceptual framework for the analysis of textual data in the context of
financial securities, hypothesizing that a comprehensive evaluation of events within the broader economic en-
vironment, particularly through their descriptions, significantly influences the pricing of financial instruments.
This research extends beyond the traditional scope of Natural Language Processing by proposing the inclu-
sion of non-textual data forms such as images, videos, and audio in the analysis. Further, it acknowledges the
recent developments in Generative Artificial Intelligence, suggesting its application to expand the breadth of
textual analysis through the generation of varied textual datasets. The hypothesis posits that the systematic
analysis of these diverse multimodal textual inputs, surpassing the conventional verbal text, could enhance the
decision-making process in financial asset management. This study aims to elucidate the potential effects of this
methodological advancement on financial market fluctuations and outlines the most pertinent NLP methodologies
for the empirical investigation of the hypothesis in future scholarly work.

Multimodal Text Analysis

Introduction
The exponential increase in data volume in the digital era
represents a significant paradigm shift, particularly in the do-
main of financial market analysis. The advent of the Internet
and social media platforms has catalyzed an unprecedented
growth in global data volumes. From a relatively modest scale
of a few dozen exabytes in 2003 Cambria and White (2014),
the year marking the emergence of social media, this figure
is projected to soar to approximately 180 zettabytes by 2025
Statista (2023). This rapid expansion of data presents both
formidable challenges and unique opportunities for contem-
porary financial analysis methodologies.
Within this context, Natural Language Processing (NLP), a
core facet of Artificial Intelligence, has emerged as an instru-
mental technology in understanding the vast and complex
datasets prevalent in today’s digital landscape. Recognized
for its efficacy in processing extensive textual information,
NLP’s applications have gained considerable traction across
multiple sectors, notably within the financial industry. How-
ever, the hypothesis posed in this paper extends the analyti-
cal reach beyond the consideration of traditional text-centric
data. It argues for an integrative framework that combines
the analysis of textual data with non-textual elements such
as images, videos, and audio. This multimodal approach is
essential to have a more holistic and nuanced understanding
of financial market dynamics.
Furthermore, the advent and integration of Generative Ar-
tificial Intelligence (AI) in data analysis signifies a pivotal
advancement in this field. The capabilities of Generative AI
to process and synthesize varied data types are anticipated
to considerably augment the analytical framework proposed
herein. This paper endeavors to elucidate this hypothesis, em-
phasizing the need for an expanded and inclusive data analy-
sis methodology in the realm of financial market analysis. The
integration of these diverse data modalities and advanced AI
technologies is not merely a response to the challenges posed
by the burgeoning data volumes but also a strategic move
to harness the potential embedded within this data-rich digi-
tal environment, as highlighted by the projections in Statista
(2023) and the insights from Cambria et al. (2014) (Cambria
and White (2014)).

Optimal
utilization
of
NLP
methods in finance
Automated techniques for processing financial data emerged
in the 1980s Xing et al. (2018). This field has evolved greatly,
alongside improvements in NLP methods. In this section, we
describe methods for effectively using NLP in finance, with
the goal of enhancing the precision and efficiency of financial
data analysis.
2.1
Integrating diverse methodologies in
NLP
for
advanced
financial
data
analysis
The advent of Generative AI marks a significant milestone,
particularly in its capacity to generate extensive training data
for NLP. Typically, this data is multi-layered, encompassing
various types and sources. Generative AI significantly simpli-
fies these manual processes, thereby enhancing the efficiency
of data interpretation. The use of NLP methods in financial
forecasting has gained such traction that it is now commonly
referred to as Natural Language-Based Financial Forecasting
(NLFF) Xing et al. (2018). Given the interdisciplinary nature
of NLP, it encompasses a blend of algorithmic techniques and
principles from economics, psychology, and sociology.
2.2
Using real-time data for analysis
The popularity of social media platforms around 2010 opened
new possibilities for analyzing real-time data. This feasibil-
ity was enabled by analyzing posts on these platforms, typi-
cally concise and adhering to a uniform syntax for opinion ex-
pression, a characteristic exemplified by Twitter’s (currently
known as X) character constraint. The stock market is often
perceived as a mirror reflecting economic events. However,
real-time data should not be considered the sole source of
truth. The past and current prices of financial instruments
may not reliably predict future prices, as suggested by Li
et al. (2020). Large datasets, such as investor opinions, can
be collected using web crawling technologies and stored in a
format conducive to effective analysis Bi (2022). The auto-
generation of financial content could be utilized for predic-
tions about how specific events might influence the financial
market. The combination of historical data with news text is
also a promising approach for analysis Nikfarjam et al. (2010).
2.3
Categorizing the input from different
sources
The financial market is characterized by a plethora of data
sources, including financial reports (such as financial state-
ments), corporate news, aggregated information from exter-
nal bodies, and social media content. Each source provides
unique information, yet they share some common features
specific to their respective categories. Various methods have
been developed to analyze this input, commonly focusing on
aspects such as text length, objectivity, and tone. While lit-
erature offers numerous established techniques for text in-
terpretation, the approach to non-text elements is relatively
nascent.
Advances in auto-interpretation technologies now
allow for the inclusion of image summaries. Furthermore, the
extensive array of podcasts can be exploited not only for au-
tomated transcription but also for analyzing the emotions of
the speakers. Incorporating all these data types offers a more
comprehensive perspective in the context of interpretability.

Multimodal Text Analysis
2.4
Advancing Financial Analysis with
Multimodal Theory and Automated
Multi-Modal Text Analysis
We argue that recent theorizing on multimodality Höllerer
et al. (2019), combined with what we already know about the
role of linguistic elements in financial markets holds the key
to overcoming the known limitations of purely verbal text fo-
cused research in finance. Given the rise of various sources
of communication that might affect financial market move-
ments, we juxtapose that multimodal theory is theoretically
expedient for increasing the granularity of our understanding
of the movement of financial assets by highlighting the mul-
titude of different materials and ‘meaning resources’ market
participants invoke Jancsary et al. (2016). In broad strokes,
multimodal research is predicated on the basic assumption
that people in and around organizations do not produce and
convey meaning solely through linguistic forms of commu-
nication, or verbal text (speech and written text), but also
through visual text (images, objects, bodily movement). Ver-
bal text is structured in a sequential and linear manner, and
often uses factual statements and rational arguments to con-
vey abstract ideas and concepts Meyer et al. (2018). This is
indicative of what Clarke et al. (2019) refer to as literal lan-
guage that conveys information in an unambiguous, fact-like
manner. Literal expressions are often complemented in real-
life settings by a type of verbal text using figurative stories or
symbolic anecdotes and metaphors to relay a more imagina-
tive sense for the respective venture. Verbal text is strongly
bound in cultural conventions Höllerer et al. (2019). Visual
text on the other hand conveys meaning in a more holistic and
emotion-evoking manner Eisenman (2013). As Meyer et al.
(2018) make clear, visual text enables a more immediate effect
on comprehension than verbal text, not least because it ap-
peals to sensory experience. Consequently, the effect of visual
text tends to be quick and often has a profound influence on
the receiver’s emotions and attitudes Joffe (2008). Meaning
conveyed by visual text tends to be more fluid and indetermi-
nate compared to verbal text (especially literal text), which
means that individuals may interpret a particular visual cue
differently based on prior experience Kernbach et al. (2015).
A multimodal perspective of financial asset movement marks
an apt choice for this hypothesis paper, first because pub-
licly traded companies tend to employ both verbal and visual
text, and second, because information sources for those mak-
ing the investment decisions such as communication videos
or corporate financial communication tend to combine verbal
and visual information.

Most
effective
techniques
of
NLP and text analysis methods
In financial market analysis, the application of Natural Lan-
guage Processing (NLP) and text analysis is increasingly
underscored by its mathematical foundations. This section
delves into the mathematical models and algorithms that un-
derpin the most effective NLP and text analysis techniques,
emphasizing their role in computational finance.
1.
Sentiment Analysis:
This technique is typically
grounded in classification algorithms. Mathematical models
like Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which use hyperplanes
in a high-dimensional space to classify data points, or neu-
ral network architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), which employ convolutional layers to process data
in a grid-like topology, are common. These models are quan-
titatively trained on labeled datasets to categorize financial
texts by sentiment.
2.
Topic Modeling: Algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) apply probabilistic models to discover la-
tent topics within text corpora. LDA assumes documents are
mixtures of topics, where a topic is characterized by a distri-
bution over words. This is mathematically represented using
Dirichlet distributions, providing a framework for uncovering
thematic structures in financial documents.
3. Named Entity Recognition (NER): NER in financial
texts often utilizes sequence modeling. Algorithms like Hid-
den Markov Models (HMMs) or Conditional Random Fields
(CRFs) apply statistical methods to label sequential data,
where the state transition probabilities are learned from train-
ing data. These models are particularly effective in identify-
ing and classifying financial entities in a sequence of text.
4.
Event Extraction: This involves parsing and seman-
tic analysis algorithms, where dependency parsing is often
employed to construct syntactic dependency trees that rep-
resent grammatical relationships between words.
Semantic
Role Labeling (SRL) further identifies the predicate-argument
structures, providing a mathematical framework for extract-
ing meaningful events from financial texts.
5. Machine Learning-Based Predictive Models: These
models often utilize regression techniques, where Ordinary
Least Squares (OLS) regression or more complex algorithms
like ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) for
time series forecasting are applied.
They mathematically
model historical data to forecast future trends in financial
markets.
6.
Deep Learning Techniques:
Techniques like Long
Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), a type of Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN), are used for their ability to model
temporal sequences and their long-range dependencies, cru-
cial for processing time-sensitive financial texts.
7. Real-Time Analysis: This involves algorithms designed
for stream processing, where time-series data is analyzed in
real-time using mathematical models that can update pre-
dictions and analyses as new data arrives, crucial for time-
sensitive financial decisions.
The application of Natural Language Processing and text
analysis in financial market analysis is increasingly character-
ized by sophisticated mathematical models and algorithms,
ranging from statistical classification and probabilistic topic
modeling to advanced deep learning architectures. The in-
tegration of Generative Artificial Intelligence holds further
promise, bringing novel mathematical approaches like Gener-
ative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformer models,
which have the potential to revolutionize the generation and

interpretation of financial texts by learning and mimicking
complex data distributions, thereby offering a more compre-
hensive and nuanced understanding of financial market dy-
namics.
