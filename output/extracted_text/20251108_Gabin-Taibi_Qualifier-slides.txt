Abstract
Modeling Narrative Dynamics for Volatility Regime Detection in Financial Markets
Research question: How do forms of narratives influence volatility and regime changes in
markets?
Research summary: Financial markets are increasingly driven by narratives, defined as collective
interpretations that influence expectations, volatility, and market regimes. Yet, despite their
central role, narratives remain largely unquantified in financial modeling. This research aims to
bridge that gap by developing a computational framework linking the evolution of financial
narratives to volatility dynamics and structural market shifts. The thesis integrates methods from
natural language processing, high–frequency econometrics, and machine learning to (1) detect and
quantify narratives across multiple textual sources, (2) measure volatility and its higher–order
properties from high–frequency data, and (3) analyze the causal and predictive relationship
between narrative shifts and volatility regimes.

Research Motivation
Rationale:
Narrative information forms a latent context for market decisions (Shiller), yet quantitative models
often overlook these textual dynamics.
Recent advances in transformer-based NLP:
Allow scalable narrative extraction, extending analysis beyond simple sentiment/polarity.
As LLMs increase textual data, this research seeks to identify which narratives matter most.
Access to high-quality, high-frequency (HFT) data allows for precise estimation of market
dynamics, including volatility and its higher-order properties.
Understanding how narrative shocks translate into volatility regime changes provides academic
and practical insights for risk management and narrative-aware trading.

PhD Thesis Cohesion
Unified Objective: The thesis establishes an integrated framework linking financial narratives and
volatility dynamics. It moves from the detection and quantification of narratives in textual data to
their empirical connection with realized and implied volatility. Each chapter contributes to
understanding how narratives emerge, evolve, and potentially drive structural changes in financial
markets.
Progressive Methodological Depth: The research follows a clear methodological progression. It
begins with a systematic literature review and conceptual definition of financial narratives,
advances to supervised and unsupervised NLP approaches for narrative detection, continues with
high-frequency volatility modeling, and culminates in causal and predictive analyses of
narrative–volatility interactions. This structure ensures increasing analytical depth and integration
across disciplines.
Scientific and Practical Relevance: The work contributes to both the theoretical foundations of
narrative economics and its quantitative applications in finance. By combining NLP, econometrics,
and machine learning, it enhances interpretability and predictive power in volatility modeling. The
results have implications for alpha research, portfolio and risk management, policy making, and
the broader understanding of information flow in financial markets.

Conclusion
Narrative Definition
Proposition:
Narratives are recurring, structured collections of financial topics that shape how market
participants interpret and respond to market information.
Each narrative is characterized by:
A set of semantically coherent topics (e.g., inflation, liquidity, policy uncertainty).
An intensity score capturing its relative prominence and emotional tone over time.
The framework allows both cyclic narratives (e.g., inflation, monetary policy) and emerging
narratives (e.g., AI, energy transition) to be modeled dynamically.
Financial Market Topics:
Macroeconomics: Inflation, growth, GDP, unemployment, fiscal policy, recession risk.
Geopolitics: Trade tensions, sanctions, wars, political uncertainty, global supply chains.
Monetary Policies: Interest rates, quantitative easing, central bank communication, forward
guidance.
Assets: Equity markets, commodities, FX, credit, volatility, crypto assets.
Etc.

Sentiment Analysis
Loughran and McDonald, 2011 Lexicon Approach:
Finance-specific lexicon classifying words as positive, negative, uncertain, or litigious.
Captures direction and uncertainty, commonly used in empirical asset pricing.
Mohammad, 2025 Lexicon Approach:
Valence–Arousal–Dominance model: measures emotional valence (pleasantness), arousal
(intensity), and dominance (control).
Provides multidimensional sentiment representation.
Applied on tokenized texts using weighted averages of VAD scores per text.
Araci, 2019 Embedding Approach:
Transformer-based language model fine-tuned on financial text corpora.
Outputs text-level probabilities for positive, neutral, and negative sentiment.

Narrative Modeling
Microeconomic narratives: 10-K, 10-Q and earning call transcripts (Flynn and Sastry, 2024);
Macroeconomic narratives: central bank speech transcripts from Feldkircher et al., 2021;
Overall narratives: Bybee et al., 2024 and ”evergreen” extended narratives, reservoirs and
super-narratives from Bhargava et al., 2023 and Lee et al., 2024:
List of predefined financial narratives (e.g., “Inflation”, “COVID-19”, “US Growth”, “Market
Crash”, etc.), classified in reservoirs and super-narratives.
Represents a stable taxonomy of market stories, allowing consistent tracking but limited discovery
of new ones.
Supervised Methods: Discover and track well-known cyclical and past temporary narratives:
Similarity Tagging: Compute cosine similarity between text embeddings and narrative descriptions;
assign top-matching narratives per text, aggregate at daily or intraday frequency to obtain
narrative intensities.
LLM Tagging: Use state-of-the art LLM with structured agentic framework to classify each text
into predefined narratives; enables interpretability and narrative revalidation through
self-consistent reasoning checks.

Narrative Modeling
Unsupervised method: Discover and track emerging narratives without predefined labels.
Based on the LDA topic-modeling from Bybee et al., 2023;
Graph-Based Topic Modeling: Enhancing the work of Grootendorst, 2022, the goal is to embed
texts using sentence-transformers, reduce dimensionality with UMAP, and cluster via Leiden
algorithm; each cluster represents a latent narrative evolving through time.
Unsupervised LLM Approach: On daily batches of text, prompt an LLM to detect narratives and
tag text.
Advantages: Captures new market themes dynamically, providing early detection of evolving
macro or micro narratives absent in predefined taxonomies.

Structural Breaks
Objective: Detect and interpret structural changes in volatility regimes through the lens of financial
narratives.
Apply multiple change–point detection techniques to volatility features: Bai–Perron multiple break
test, CUSUM and Bayesian and Kernel-based methods for robustness.

Align detected breakpoints with changes in narrative intensities and sentiment indicators:
Overall (news headlines)
Macroeconomic narratives (policy, inflation, liquidity).
Micro narratives (corporate risk, earnings uncertainty).
Evaluate whether narrative shocks precede or coincide with structural volatility transitions.
Output: Narrative–aligned map of volatility regime shifts, providing interpretability to purely statistical

Causality Analysis:
Test causal direction between narrative intensities and volatility components (realized and implied,
volatility, roughness, vol-of-vol).
Combine econometric and machine learning methods? E.g.: Granger causality, transfer entropy,
Double Machine Learning, and Causal Forests.
Forecasting Framework:
Integrate narrative features into volatility forecasting models.
Evaluate predictive gains versus baseline volatility models.
Explore narrative-timed volatility factor strategies (e.g., “short rough, long smooth” regimes).

Summary of Contributions
Thesis goal: Model financial narratives and volatility co-dynamics using NLP, econometrics, and
high-frequency data.
Establish a unified framework to quantify, track, and compare macro, micro, and market-wide
financial narratives.
Build high-frequency datasets and open-source tools (realized-library, TOPol) for volatility
and semantic analysis.
Develop a complete volatility modeling pipeline: realized, implied, roughness, and vol-of-vol.
Connect narrative shifts to volatility and explain and forecast regime transitions.
Broader impact:
Contributes to the empirical foundations of Narrative Economics.
Enhances financial stability analysis, risk management, and macro-financial policy interpretation.
Future research directions:
Extend the narrative–volatility framework to cross-asset and international markets.
Model information diffusion and contagion through narrative propagation networks.
Explore narrative-based volatility factors for portfolio construction and risk monitoring.
Incorporate multimodal features (text, price, and sentiment) into deep forecasting architectures.
