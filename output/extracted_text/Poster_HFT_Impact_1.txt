Background
The rapid evolution of electronic financial markets, driven by technological ad-
vancements such as ultra-low-latency trading systems, high-performance comput-
ing, and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) technology, has transformed
the landscape of trading. These innovations have enabled the rise of Ultra-Fast
Traders (UFT) and High-Frequency Traders (HFT), also known as Low-Latency
Traders (LLT), who can react to market events within a few microseconds. These
ultra-fast reaction capabilities set them apart from conventional market partici-
pants, making them a unique force in financial markets.
Understanding the role and behavior of these traders is critical to analyzing modern
market dynamics. UFTs and HFTs play a significant role in liquidity and price
formation, but their impact on market stability and efficiency remains the subject
of ongoing debate.
Research Objectives
▶Contributing to the ongoing discussion about the role of ultra-fast trading in
financial markets.
▶Proposing a novel market participants’ classification method.
▶Providing a detailed analysis of participation rates and trading behaviors of
UFT and HFT.
▶Analyzing if and how these participants affect market microstructure,
efficiency, and volatility.
Data and Preprocessing
The study is based on nanoseconds timestamp data from Deutsche B¨orse’s T7
platform, starting from January 2021 until September 2024. Specifically, we se-
lected Euro STOXX 50 and DAX Futures, along with MSCI World and S&P500
iShares ETFs for their high liquidity on Eurex and Xetra, although only the Euro
STOXX 50 results are presented on this poster.
To classify a specific market event, we have based our approach on the latency
between a prior triggering trade and the event. Events with a latency of less
than 1µs are classified as UFT-triggered, latencies between 1µs and
10µs as HFT-triggered, while latencies exceeding 10µs are attributed
to conventional traders. Additionally, negative latencies are attributed to noise.
Methodology
▶The total participation is measured as the sum of the notional value (price
× quantity) for all market events triggered by a given participant category.
▶Other participation types: aggressive, passive, canceled, and deep (beyond
the first order book level).
▶Aggregated tick-to-trade data into 1-minute intervals to compute metrics:
traded volume, average spread, effective spread, depth, order imbalance ratio
(OIR), and mid/micro/trade price volatility.
▶Included a control variable similar to SNR.
▶Combined 1-minute data into monthly datasets and divided into 5 total
participation quantiles.
Conclusion
▶LLT (both UFT and HFT) produce, at most, roughly 20% of total
participation, including aggressive and passive (Fig. 1).
▶All participants primarily generate passive order data, with UFTs
contributing almost no passive orders (Fig. 1): market making strategies?
▶UFTs cancel around 80% of their orders, but this represents, at most, 20%
of total canceled participation. (Fig. 2).
▶The deep order book participation (often considered noise) is insignificant,
at most 0.06% (Fig. 3).
▶Clear correlation between high LLT participation and all eight metrics (Fig.
4), but the impact is positive on spread, effective spread, depth and OIR.
▶Interesting difference between UFT and HFT’s behaviour: UFTs’ SNR
decreases with higher participation while HFTs’ SNR is stable or slightly
increases with higher participation (Fig. 5)
▶Causal effect study (ongoing)

Further Work
Next steps will involve evaluating the classification performance using proprietary
data from Deutsche B¨orse.
Then, we will focus on identifying intraday patterns in LLT participation, particu-
larly how they react to macroeconomic events or news, leveraging NLP to assess
both the nature and speed of these reactions. This will provide insight into their
behavior in response to key events. Another important avenue will be to explore
flash crashes, investigating whether these are triggered by ’micro’ bubble bursts,
contributing to market instability during extreme volatility.
