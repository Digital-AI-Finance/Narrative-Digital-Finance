\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Overview of ultra-fast and high-frequency trading (UFT and HFT)
    \item Critics on UFTs/HFT: market manipulations (quote spoofing/stuffing/sniffing), latency arbitrage (front running, more or less equal to quote sniffing), flash crashes, higher volatility
    \item Objectives and structure of the paper
\end{itemize}

\section{Theoretical Background}
\begin{itemize}
    \item UF and HFTs participation rate (cf paper 1)
    \item Theory of efficient markets and its critics ("fake" liquidity due to high cancellation rates and a lot of noise)
    \item Volatility estimation in modern financial markets (Close-to-Close standard deviation, mid/trade price Realized Variance/Kernel?)
    \item What is Liquidity?
\end{itemize}

\section{Literature Review}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Market micro-structures analysis
    \item Liquidity: a more complex and yet not well defined concept
    \item Empirical studies on UF/HFTs impacts
\end{itemize}

\section{Data and Methodology}
\label{sec:datamethod}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Description of data: public data (HPT/HPT All files and A7 Analytics Platform), period, markets (Eurex and Xetra), instruments (Eurostoxx, Dax and Eurobund futures, equities, and ETFs)
    \item Data prepossessing: filtering most liquid instrument reaction events (but kept all trigger trades are considered), gathering orderbook and BBO updates data, 1 min time interval aggregation
    \item Reaction latency based classification (FPGA/HFTs/non-HFTs)
    \item Methodology to classify noise/signal reaction events
    \item Participation Metrics (quote currency volume \%): total, aggressive/passive, signal/noise, liquidity adding/removing
    \item Market Quality Metrics: volatility (mid, micro and trade price realized kernels), tick and effective tick spread, depth, order imbalance, and Liquidity Flow
    \item Hypotheses
\end{itemize}

\section{Empirical Results}
\label{sec:results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Impact of UFTs and HFTs noise orders
    \item Impact of UFTs and HFTs aggressive orders
    \item Impact of UFTs and HFTs removing liquidity orders (toxic flow, front-running trades and cancellation)
    \item Impact of UFTs and HFTs total participation
    \item Robustness checks
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Comparison with existing studies
    \item Implications for market efficiency and stability
    \item Limitations and potential areas for misclassification (arbitrary threshold and signal/noise misclassifications)
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Summary of key findings
    \item Future research directions: refining noise/signal classification (machine learning approach), impact on different markets
\end{itemize}
