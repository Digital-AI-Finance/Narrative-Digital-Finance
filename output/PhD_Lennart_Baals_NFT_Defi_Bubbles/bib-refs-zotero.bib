	abstract = {Using individual-level data on homeowner debt and defaults from 1997 to 2008, we show that borrowing against the increase in home equity by existing homeowners is responsible for a significant fraction of both the sharp rise in U.S. household leverage from 2002 to 2006 and the increase in defaults from 2006 to 2008. Employing land topology-based housing supply elasticity as an instrument for house price growth, we estimate that the average homeowner extracts 25 to 30 cents for every dollar increase in home equity. Money extracted from increased home equity is not used to purchase new real estate or pay down high credit card balances, which suggests that borrowed funds may be used for real outlays (i.e., consumption or home improvement). Home equity-based borrowing is stronger for younger households, households with low credit scores, and households with high initial credit card utilization rates. Homeowners in high house price appreciation areas experience a relative decline in default rates from 2002 to 2006 as they borrow heavily against their home equity, but experience very high default rates from 2006 to 2008. Our estimates suggest that home equity-based borrowing is equal to 2.8\% of GDP every year from 2002 to 2006, and accounts for at least 34\% of new defaults from 2006 to 2008.},

However, the relationship between aggregated P2P interest rates and the general economy will be of interest to investors and borrowers as the P2P credit market matures. We show that the variation in P2P interest rates across grade types is determined by three macroeconomic latent factors formed by Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)—macro default, investor uncertainty, and the fundamental value of the market. However, the variation in P2P interest rates across term types cannot be explained by the general economy.},

	abstract = {Fintech has been playing an increasing role in shaping financial and banking landscapes. Banks have been concerned about the uneven playing field because fintech lenders are not subject to the same rigorous oversight. There have also been concerns about the use of alternative data sources by fintech lenders and the impact on financial inclusion. In this paper, we explore the advantages/disadvantages of loans made by a large fintech lender and similar loans that were originated through traditional banking channels. Specifically, we use account-level data from the LendingClub and Y-14M bank stress test data. We find that LendingClub’s consumer lending activities have penetrated areas that lose bank branches and in those in highly concentrated banking markets. LendingClub borrowers are, on average, more risky than traditional borrowers given the same FICO scores. We also find a high correlation between interest rate spreads, LendingClub rating grades, and loan performance. However, the correlations between the rating grades and FICO scores (at origination) have declined from about 80 percent (for loans that were originated in 2007) to only about 35 percent for recent vintages (originated in 2014-2015) -- indicating that alternative data has been increasingly used. The use of alternative information sources has allowed some borrowers who would be classified as subprime by traditional criteria to be slotted into “better” loan grades and therefore get lower priced credit. Also, for the same risk of default, consumers pay smaller spreads on loans from the LendingClub than from credit card borrowing.},

We demonstrate the application and ease of extensions of R2-RD via two different datasets: macroeconomic and futures markets. Numerical experiments also illustrate how different macroeconomic regimes separate the performance of mutual funds, allowing for regime-aware asset management. The findings make R2-RD an ideal support for data-driven decision models, and the implementations can be leveraged across investments, credit, risk, policies, etc.},

R2K-Means directly modiﬁes the K-Means algorithm by replacing the random initialization step with centroid information from the previous time period. This deterministic alteration is shown to improve centroid stability and mitigate the issues of initialization sensitivity and cluster mislabeling.

Until the 1990’s it was a purely theoretical analysis of the problem of function estimation from a given collection of data. In the middle of the 1990’s new types of learning algorithms (called support vector machines) based on the developed theory were proposed. This made statistical learning theory not only a tool for the theoretical analysis but also a tool for creating practical algorithms for estimating multidimensional functions. This article presents a very general overview of statistical learning theory including both theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the theory. The goal of this overview is to demonstrate how the abstract learning theory established conditions for generalization which are more general than those discussed in classical statistical paradigms and how the understanding of these conditions inspired new algorithmic approaches to function estimation problems. A more detailed overview of the theory (without proofs) can be found in Vapnik (1995). In Vapnik (1998) one can ﬁnd detailed description of the theory (including proofs).},

	abstract = {For the emerging peer-to-peer (P2P) lending markets to survive, they need to employ credit-risk management practices such that an investor base is profitable in the long run. Traditionally, credit-risk management relies on credit scoring that predicts loans’ probability of default. In this paper, we use a profit scoring approach that is based on modeling the annualized adjusted internal rate of returns of loans. To validate our profit scoring models with traditional credit scoring models, we use data from a European P2P lending market, Bondora, and also a random sample of loans from the Lending Club P2P lending market. We compare the out-of-sample accuracy and profitability of the credit and profit scoring models within several classes of statistical and machine learning models including the following: logistic and linear regression, lasso, ridge, elastic net, random forest, and neural networks. We found that our approach outperforms standard credit scoring models for Lending Club and Bondora loans. More specifically, as opposed to credit scoring models, returns across all loans are 24.0\% (Bondora) and 15.5\% (Lending Club) higher, whereas accuracy is 6.7\% (Bondora) and 3.1\% (Lending Club) higher for the proposed profit scoring models. Moreover, our results are not driven by manual selection as profit scoring models suggest investing in more loans. Finally, even if we consider data sampling bias, we found that the set of superior models consists almost exclusively of profit scoring models. Thus, our results contribute to the literature by suggesting a paradigm shift in modeling credit-risk in the P2P market to prefer profit as opposed to credit-risk scoring models.},

	abstract = {As a novel financing method, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has drawn extensive attention as it provides those financers who cannot participate in the traditional financial market with funds. In P2P lending marketplaces, one of the crucial challenges that P2P online lending platforms are facing is to accurately predict the default risk of each loan by tapping into default prediction models, thus effectively helping P2P lending companies avoid credit risks. That traditional credit risk prediction models fail to meet the demand of P2P lending companies for default risk prediction, which is because of the uneven distribution of credit data samples in the P2P lending marketplaces (i.e., the default sampled data are scarce). In this paper, we designed a multi-round ensemble learning model based on heterogeneous ensemble frameworks to predict default risk. In this model, an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is initially used for ensemble learning, and the XGBoost, deep neural network, and logistic regression are then regarded as heterogeneous individual learners to undergo a linear weighted fusion. To verify the designed default risk prediction model, real credit data from a famous P2P online lending marketplace in China were used in a test. The results of the experiment indicate that this model can effectively increase the predictive accuracy compared with traditional machine learning models and ensemble learning models. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This study presents an analysis of the impact of asset price bubbles on the markets for cryptocurrencies and con-siders the standard risk management measure Value-at-Risk (“VaR”). We apply the theory of local martingales, present a styled model of asset price bubbles in continuous time and perform a simulation experiment featuring one- and two-dimensional Stochastic Differential Equation (“SDE”) systems for asset value through a Constant Elasticity of Variance (“CEV”) process that can detect bubble behavior. In an empirical analysis across several widely traded cryptocurrencies, we find that the estimated parameters of one-dimensional SDE systems do not show evidence of bubble behavior. However, if we estimate a two-dimensional system jointly with an equity market index, we do detect a bubble, and comparing bubble to non-bubble economies it is shown that asset price bubbles result in materially inflated VaR measures. The implication of this finding for portfolio and risk management is that rather than acting as a diversifying asset class, cryptocurrencies may not only be highly correlated with other assets but have anti-diversification properties that materially inflate the downside risks in portfolios combining these asset types. We also measure the model risk arising from mispecifying the process driving cryptocurrencies by ignoring the relationship to another representative risk asset through applying the principle of relative entropy, where we find that across all cryptocurrencies studied that the distributions of a distance measure between the simulated distributions of VaR are almost all highly skewed to the right and very heavy-tailed. We find that in the majority of cases that the model risk “multipliers” range in about two to five across cryptocurrencies, estimates which could be applied to establish a model risk reserve as part of an economic capital calculation for risk management of cryptocurrencies.},

This empirical research aims to evaluate the performance of different Machine Learning algorithms for credit risk prediction with more focus on Random Forest Trees. Several experiments inspired by observation and literature illustrate the potentials of computer-based model in classifying a number of bank history records. However, enhanced classification outcomes require tuning the randomness and tree growing parameters of the Random Forests algorithm.

            We analyze the information content of a digital footprint—that is, information that users leave online simply by accessing or registering on a Web site—for predicting consumer default. We show that even simple, easily accessible variables from a digital footprint match the information content of credit bureau scores. A digital footprint complements rather than substitutes for credit bureau information and affects access to credit and reduces default rates. We discuss the implications for financial intermediaries’ business models, access to credit for the unbanked, and the behavior of consumers, firms, and regulators in the digital sphere.

We approach the problem of credit risk for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems by presenting a latent factor-based classification technique to divide the population into major network communities in order to estimate a more efficient logistic model. Given a number of attributes that capture firm performances in a financial system, we adopt a latent position model which allow us to distinguish between communities of connected and not-connected firms based on the spatial position of the latent factors. We show through empirical illustration that incorporating the latent factor-based classification of firms is particularly suitable as it improves the predictive performance of P2P scoring models.},

We then build a credit score model for each cluster via lasso-type regularization logistic regression. We compare our approach with the conventional logistic model by analyzing the credit score of over 1,5000 SMEs engaged in P2P lending services across Europe.

Recent studies shift from using logit and survival analysis methods to examine funding success and default predictions, towards applying artificial intelligence. There is a controversial debate regarding adopting a self-regulatory approach versus stricter financial institutions-based regulations with a few studies suggesting a hybrid approach. We suggest several avenues for future research, such as examining the determinants and performance of P2P lending platforms in emerging and developing markets; regulatory differences, the effects of behavioral characteristics such as cultural impact, language, information technology literacy, and the innovation quotient on P2P funding attributes; and the relationship between P2P lending and traditional finance channels.},

These procedures are useful as warning alerts in surveillance strategies conducted by central banks and fiscal regulators with real‐time data. Use of these methods over long historical periods presents a more serious econometric challenge due to the complexity of the nonlinear structure and break mechanisms that are inherent in multiple‐bubble phenomena within the same sample period. To meet this challenge, this article develops a new recursive flexible window method that is better suited for practical implementation with long historical time series. The method is a generalized version of the sup augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test of Phillips et al. (“Explosive behavior in the 1990s NASDAQ: When did exuberance escalate asset values?”

Simulations show that the test significantly improves discriminatory power and leads to distinct power gains when multiple bubbles occur. An empirical application of the methodology is conducted on S\&P 500 stock market data over a long historical period from January 1871 to December 2010. The new approach successfully identifies the well‐known historical episodes of exuberance and collapses over this period, whereas the strategy of PWY and a related cumulative sum (CUSUM) dating procedure locate far fewer episodes in the same sample range.},

Decentralization becomes preferable under weaker intertemporal incentives and when validators are drawn from market participants.

	abstract = {Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are an essential component of the nascent decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The most common DEXs are so-called automated market makers (AMMs): smart contracts that pool liquidity and process trades as atomic swaps of tokens. AMMs price transactions with a deterministic liquidity invariance rule that only uses the AMM’s token deposits as inputs and that has no precedent in traditional finance. Yet, in the context of transparent and open blockchain operations, any liquidity invariance pricing function allows so-called sandwich attacks (akin to front running) that increase the cost of trading and threaten the long-term viability of the DeFi ecosystem. Invariance pricing is also not regret free. Linear pricing rules have similar problems except for uniform pricing, which has regret-free prices and limits sandwich attack profits but which invites excessive order splitting. Comparing trading costs using a model of liquidity provision, constant product pricing is often cheaper except when the variance of the under­ lying asset is small or when the order is large.},

            The rise of centralized mining pools for risk sharing does not necessarily undermine the decentralization required for blockchains: because of miners’ cross-pool diversification and pool managers’ endogenous fee setting, larger pools better internalize their externality on global hash rates, charge higher fees, attract disproportionately fewer miners, and grow more slowly. Instead, mining pools as a financial innovation escalate miners’ arms race and significantly increase the energy consumption of proof-of-work-based blockchains. Empirical evidence from Bitcoin mining supports our model’s predictions. The economic insights inform other consensus protocols and the industrial organization of mainstream sectors with similar characteristics but ambiguous prior findings.},

Hailed by some as the currency of the future, these “cryptocurrencies” have gained notoriety for their use in online black markets, but have yet to gain widespread acceptance. Given their novelty and lack of central regulating authorities, digital currencies experience high volatility and uncertainty regarding value. Taking Bitcoin as a representative example, this paper first uses autoregressive moving average (ARMA) functions to explain trading values, then applies log-­‐periodic power law (LPPL) models in an attempt to predict crashes. The results of ARMA modeling show that Bitcoin values react to the CBOE Volatility Index, suggesting that a primary force currently driving Bitcoin values is speculation by investors looking outside traditional markets. In addition, the LPPL models accurately predict ex-­‐ante the crash that occurred in December 2013, making LPPL models a potentially valuable tool for understanding bubble behavior in digital currencies.},

            We show that search frictions in credit markets affect accepted interest rates and loan sizes and distort consumption. Using data on car loan applications and originations not intermediated by car dealers, we isolate quasi-exogenous variation in both the costs and benefits to searching for credit. After identifying lender-specific policies that price risk discontinuously, we study the differential response to offered interest rates by borrowers who face high and low search costs. High-search-cost borrowers are 10\${\textbackslash}\%\$ more likely to accept loan offers with higher markups, consequently originating smaller loans and purchasing older and less expensive cars than lower-search-cost borrowers.

In our analysis, we include economic signals of volume and price of exchange for USD, adoption of the Bitcoin technology and transaction volume of Bitcoin. We add social signals related to information search, word of mouth volume, emotional valence and opinion polarization as expressed in tweets related to Bitcoin for more than 3 years. Our analysis reveals that increases in opinion polarization and exchange volume precede rising Bitcoin prices, and that emotional valence precedes opinion polarization and rising exchange volumes. We apply these insights to design algorithmic trading strategies for Bitcoin, reaching very high profits in less than a year. We verify this high profitability with robust statistical methods that take into account risk and trading costs, confirming the long-standing hypothesis that trading-based social media sentiment has the potential to yield positive returns on investment.},

Herding in the NFT market tends to arise when the return on Ethereum increases, but it tends to diminish as the return on Bitcoin increases. Meanwhile, unlike in traditional asset markets, herding in NFT markets does not appear to happen across submarkets (OpenSea, Atomic, Cryptokitties, Godsunchained, and Decentraland). Active investors herd to trade NFTs within different collections and follow the market consensus when they are making investment decisions on NFTs listed on OpenSea.

            We document three phenomena we jointly refer to as monthly payment targeting. First, using data from 500,000 used auto loans and discontinuities in contract terms offered by hundreds of lenders, we show that demand is more sensitive to maturity than to interest rate, consistent with consumers managing payment size when making debt decisions. Second, many consumers appear to employ segregated mental accounts, spending exogenous payment savings on larger loans. Third, consumers bunch at round number monthly payment amounts, consistent with heuristic budgeting. That these patterns hold in subsamples of likely constrained and unconstrained borrowers challenges liquidity constraints as a complete explanation.},

Unlike traditional numerical maximization approaches, this methodology benefits from closed-form solutions for parameter estimation, enhancing its practicality for real-time applications and historical data exercises with focus on frequent updates. In a nowcasting application to vintage US data, I study the information content and relative performance of regime-switching model after each data releases in a fifteen year period, which was only feasible due to the time efficiency of the proposed estimation methodology. While existing literature has already acknowledged the performance improvement of nowcasting models under regime-switching, this paper shows that the superior nowcasting performance observed particularly when key economic indicators are released. In a backcasting exercise, I show that the model can closely match the recession starting and ending dates of the NBER despite having less information than actual committee meetings, where the fit between actual dates and model estimates becomes more apparent with the additional available information and recession end dates are fully covered with a lag of three to six months. Given that the EM algorithm proposed in this paper is suitable for various regimeswitching configurations, this paper provides economists and policymakers with a valuable tool for conducting comprehensive analyses, ranging from point estimates to information decomposition and persistence of recessions in larger datasets.},

First, we identify the period during which two important Bitcoin bubbles occurred based on the generalized supremum augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) method. There are two significant bubble cycles. The first bubble lasted approximately 26 days from November 25, 2017, to December 21, 2017, while the second bubble lasted approximately one week from June 22 to June 29, 2019. The occurrence of the first bubble was related to the considerable expansion of initial coin offerings (ICOs) in 2017, while the formation of the second bubble was affected by the release of Libra. Second, as the GSADF method cannot be used to accurately infer the time at which a bubble bursts, we employ the log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) model for this purpose. We verify that the LPPLS method can not only infer the timing of a bubble burst but also shows stable results. Finally, we demonstrate the implications of the 2019 bubble. During the 2019 bubble, due to the increased supervision of European and American governments and the impact of hedging assets, the bubble’s duration was shorter, and the positive feedback mechanism was not as strong as that of the 2017 bubble. In addition, the oscillating frequency of the bubble in 2019 was low and unstable, which means that it would be more beneficial for investors to hold the currency for a long time.},

	abstract = {Understanding structural regime shifts in crypto asset markets is vital for early detection of systemic risk. This study applies the Generalized Sup Augmented Dickey–Fuller (GSADF) test to daily high-frequency price data of five major crypto assets—BTC, ETH, SOL, AAVE, and BCH—from 2023 to 2025. The results reveal asset-specific structural breaks: BTC and BCH aligned with macroeconomic shocks, while DeFi tokens (e.g., AAVE, SOL) exhibited fragmented, project-driven shifts. The S\&P 500 index, in contrast, showed no persistent regime shifts, indicating greater structural stability. To examine inter-asset linkages, we construct co-occurrence matrices based on GSADF breakpoints. These reveal strong coexplosivity between BTC and other assets, and unexpectedly weak synchronization between ETH and AAVE, underscoring the sectoral idiosyncrasies of DeFi tokens. While the GSADF test remains central to our analysis, we also employ a Markov Switching Model (MSM) as a secondary tool to capture short-term volatility clustering. Together, these methods provide a layered view of long- and short-term market dynamics. This study highlights crypto markets’ structural heterogeneity and proposes scalable computational frameworks for real-time monitoring of explosive behavior.},

	abstract = {We develop a strong diagnostic for bubbles and crashes in Bitcoin, by analysing the coincidence (and its absence) of fundamental and technical indicators. Using a generalized Metcalfe’s Law based on network properties, a fundamental value is quantified and shown to be heavily exceeded, on at least four occasions, by bubbles that grow and burst. In these bubbles, we detect a universal super-exponential unsustainable growth. We model this universal pattern with the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model, which parsimoniously captures diverse positive feedback phenomena, such as herding and imitation. The LPPLS model is shown to provide an ex ante warning of market instabilities, quantifying a high crash hazard and probabilistic bracket of the crash time consistent with the actual corrections; although, as always, the precise time and trigger (which straw breaks the camel’s back) is exogenous and unpredictable. Looking forward, our analysis identifies a substantial but not unprecedented overvaluation in the price of Bitcoin, suggesting many months of volatile sideways Bitcoin prices ahead (from the time of writing, March 2018).},

	abstract = {Motivated by the growing practice of using social network data in credit scoring, we analyze the impact of using network-based measures on customer score accuracy and on tie formation among customers. We develop a series of models to compare the accuracy of customer scores obtained with and without network data. We also investigate how the accuracy of social network-based scores changes when consumers can strategically construct their social networks to attain higher scores. We find that those who are motivated to improve their scores may form fewer ties and focus more on similar partners. The impact of such endogenous tie formation on the accuracy of consumer scores is ambiguous. Scores can become more accurate as a result of modifications in social networks, but this accuracy improvement may come with greater network fragmentation. The threat of social exclusion in such endogenously formed networks provides incentives to low-type members to exert effort that improves everyone’s creditworthiness. We discuss implications for managers and public policy.},

This paper firstly proposes a new direct proxy for the public’s attention in the NFT market: the non-fungible tokens attention index (NFTsAI), based on 590m news stories from the LexisNexis News \& Business database and applies the historical decomposition to assess the historical variations of the NFTsAI. Then the empirical analysis is performed via a TVP-VAR volatility spillover connectedness model. The empirical results show that NFTsAI indicates NFT markets are dominated by cryptocurrency, DeFi, equity, bond, commodity, F.X. and gold markets. And NFT markets are volatility spillover receivers. In addition, NFT assets could impede financial contagion and have significant diversification benefits. Employing a panel pooled OLS regression model as a supplementary analysis and a GARCH-MIDAS model as a robustness test. This study reveals that NFTsAI has sufficient power to explain the return of NFT assets from a fixed effect perspective, and NFTsAI contains useful forecasting information for both short and long-term volatility of NFT markets, separately. The new NFTsAI and the empirical findings contain useful insights for risk-averse investors, portfolio managers, institutional investors, academics and financial policy regulators.},

Subsequently, the heterogeneous factors for the above nexus are investigated based on the micro characteristics of FinTech companies and the macro environment. On this basis, the mechanism of the above effect is also analyzed, and it is shown that the FinTech monopoly impacts systemic risk mainly via inducing excessive consumption, increasing banks’ credit risk, and inhibiting the development of FinTech.},

To gain further insights into the downfall, we employ state-of-the-art network science instruments to model the evolutionary dependency structures of 199 cryptocurrencies on an hourly basis, and we investigate tick-by-tick public trades at the time of the events. We identify the collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem as the pivotal event that triggered a significant decrease in the exchange’s liquidity. Results suggest that the crash was actively accelerated by Binance tweets causing a systemic reaction in the cryptocurrency market. Finally, identifying the actors who mostly benefited from the FTX’s collapse and highlighting a generalised trend toward centralisation in the crypto space, we emphasise the importance of genuinely decentralised finance for a transparent, future digital economy.},

This performance measure takes into account the expected proﬁts and losses of credit granting and thereby better aligns the model developers’ objectives with those of the lending company. It is based on the Expected Maximum Proﬁt (EMP) measure and is used to ﬁnd a trade-off between the expected losses – driven by the exposure of the loan and the loss given default –and the operational income given by the loan. Additionally, one of the major advantages of using the proposed measure is that it permits to calculate the optimal cutoff value, which is necessary for model implementation. To test the proposed approach, we use a dataset of loans granted by a government institution, and benchmarked the accuracy and monetary gain of using EMP, accuracy, and the area under the ROC curve as measures for selecting model parameters, and for determining the respective cutoff values. The results show that our proposed proﬁt-based classiﬁcation measure outperforms the alternative approaches in terms of both accuracy and monetary value in the test set, and that it facilitates model deployment.},

It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone.

Banks survive an erosion of trust better than non-banks. Banks' trust advantage arises from the lower cost of funding due to insured deposits and an endogenous belief revision channel that complements the effect of the funding cost advantage. The results have novel policy relevance for deposit insurance scope.},

	abstract = {Starting on February 20, 2020, the global stock markets began to suffer the worst decline since the Great Recession in 2008, and the COVID-19 has been widely blamed on the stock market crashes. In this study, we applied the log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) methodology based on multilevel time series to unravel the underlying mechanisms of the 2020 global stock market crash by analyzing the trajectories of 10 major world stock market indexes from both developed and emergent stock markets, including the S\&P 500, the DJIA, and the NASDAQ from the United State, the FTSE from the United Kingdom, the DAX from Germany, the NIKKEI from Japan, the CSI 300 from China, the HSI from Hong Kong, the BSESN from India, and the BOVESPA from Brazil. In order to effectively distinguish between endogenous crash and exogenous crash in stock market, we proposed using the LPPLS confidence indicator as a classification proxy. The results show that the apparent LPPLS bubble patterns of the super-exponential increase, corrected by the accelerating logarithm-periodic oscillations, have indeed presented in the price trajectories of the seven indexes: S\&P 500, DJIA, NASDAQ, DAX, CSI 300, BSESN, and BOVESPA, indicating that the large positive bubbles have formed endogenously prior to the 2020 stock market crash, and the subsequent crashes for the seven indexes are endogenous, stemming from the increasingly systemic instability of the stock markets inherently, while the well-known external shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the corporate debt bubble, and the 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war, only served as sparks during the 2020 global stock market crash. In contrast, the crashes in the three remaining indexes: FTSE, NIKKEI, and HSI, are exogenous and hence are perhaps the only crashes truly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also found that in terms of the regime changes of the stock markets, no obvious LPPLS negative bubble pattern has been observed in the price trajectories of the 10 stock market indexes, indicating that the regime changes from a bear market to a bull market in late March 2020 are exogenous, stemming from external factors. The unprecedented market and economy rescue efforts from federal reserves and central banks across the world in unison may have played a critical role in quelling the 2020 global stock market crash in the nick of time. This paper creates a paradigm for future studies in real-time crash detection and underlying mechanism dissection. It serves to warn us of the imminent risks in not only the stock market but also other financial markets and economic indexes.},

	abstract = {In the past decade, Bitcoin as an emerging asset class has gained widespread public attention because of their extraordinary returns in phases of extreme price growth and their unpredictable massive crashes. We apply the log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) confidence indicator as a diagnostic tool for identifying bubbles using the daily data on Bitcoin price in the past two years. We find that the LPPLS confidence indicator based on the daily Bitcoin price data fails to provide effective warnings for detecting the bubbles when the Bitcoin price suffers from a large fluctuation in a short time, especially for positive bubbles. In order to diagnose the existence of bubbles and accurately predict the bubble crashes in the cryptocurrency market, this study proposes an adaptive multilevel time series detection methodology based on the LPPLS model and a finer (than daily) timescale for the Bitcoin price data. We adopt two levels of time series, 1 h and 30 min, to demonstrate the adaptive multilevel time series detection methodology. The results show that the LPPLS confidence indicator based on this new method is an outstanding instrument to effectively detect the bubbles and accurately forecast the bubble crashes, even if a bubble exists in a short time. In addition, we discover that the short-term LPPLS confidence indicator being highly sensitive to the extreme fluctuations of Bitcoin price can provide some useful insights into the bubble status on a shorter time scale – on a day to week scale, while the long-term LPPLS confidence indicator has a stable performance in terms of effectively monitoring the bubble status on a longer time scale – on a week to month scale. The adaptive multilevel time series detection methodology can provide real-time detection of bubbles and advanced forecast of crashes to warn of the imminent risk in not only the cryptocurrency market but also other financial markets.},

Using a theoretical model that assumes heterogeneity in lenders’ screening abilities and borrowers’ investment horizons, we show that FinTech (Traditional) lenders primarily supply unsecured (asset-backed) loans to borrowers with short-term (long-term) projects. The model builds on the interplay between screening ability and collateral requirements to characterize the competition between two ex-ante symmetric lenders. Lenders use screening technology and collateral requirements to mitigate competition and restrict the supply of credit through an endogenous segmentation of the loan market. As information technology improves, the effect on credit supply and equilibrium interest rates becomes more nuanced and depends on the market segment. The results offer a supply-side explanation for the growth of unsecured lending.},

Regarding sys­ temic risk, FinTech firms are more exposed/vulnerable to systemic shocks than traditional FIs. However, they do not contribute to higher systemic risk as compared to traditional FIs. There is no substantial evidence that bank market power (captured by Lerner index) reduces due to the growth of FinTech firms. Yet, there is partial evi­ dence that some accounting performances of banks may decline due to the growth of FinTech firms. Since FinTech firms are highly exposed/vulnerable to systemic shock, regulators should continue monitoring FinTech development closely and ensure that investors are aware of the risk and retail consumers of these firms are well protected.},

On-chain transaction data shows that loan durations are short (31 days on average), and many users borrow to support leveraged in­ vestment strategies (yield farming).

	abstract = {Statistical default models, widely used to assess default risk, fail to account for a change in the relations between different variables resulting from an underlying change in agent behavior. We demonstrate this phenomenon using data on securitized subprime mortgages issued in the period 1997–2006. As the level of securitization increases, lenders have an incentive to originate loans that rate high based on characteristics that are reported to investors, even if other unreported variables imply a lower borrower quality. Consistent with this behavior, we find that over time lenders set interest rates only on the basis of variables that are reported to investors, ignoring other credit-relevant information. As a result, among borrowers with similar reported characteristics, over time the set that receives loans becomes worse along the unreported information dimension. This change in lender behavior alters the data generating process by transforming the mapping from observables to loan defaults. To illustrate this effect, we show that the interest rate on a loan becomes a worse predictor of default as securitization increases. Moreover, a statistical default model estimated in a low securitization period breaks down in a high securitization period in a systematic manner: it underpredicts defaults among borrowers for whom soft information is more valuable. Regulations that rely on such models to assess default risk could, therefore, be undermined by the actions of market participants. \& 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

            Inaccurate borrower-provided information in marketplace loans is informative about credit risk. An inaccuracy index constructed from the consistency of loan amount with outstanding credit balance, roundness of reported income, and roundness of chosen loan amount predicts the likelihood of default, and the additional default risk is not compensated by higher interest. Inaccurate information is more prevalent in areas with lower social capital and weaker social norms. It is also lower among borrowers whose professions are considered less honest, and among borrowers with higher income uncertainty. These results suggest that inaccuracy is driven by both deliberate misreporting and genuine uncertainty. (JEL D12, D91, G23, G41)

	abstract = {The misclassiﬁcation of loan applicants by credit scoring model is one of the main factors causing the loss of investors’ proﬁts in P2P lending. Class imbalance of credit data is a main factor that affects classiﬁcation performance of the model. Most existing methods of addressing class imbalance in credit scoring worked on improving the prediction accuracy for minority class samples (bad credit), which usually led to decreasing the prediction performance for majority class samples (good credit) signiﬁcantly. In this paper, we propose a novel resampling ensemble model based on data distribution (REMDD) for imbalanced credit risk evaluation in P2P lending. REMMD solves class imbalance problem by using proposed undersampling method based on majority class data distribution (UMCDD). To further improve classiﬁcation performance of REMMD, base classiﬁers with better comprehensive performance on the validation set are used to conduct class prediction. We validate the classiﬁcation performance of REMDD on the three real and representative P2P lending credit datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that REMDD not only has good prediction performance for both majority class and minority class, but also effectively improves the comprehensive classiﬁcation performance for imbalanced credit risk evaluation in P2P lending, compared with existing models.},

            An increase in the household debt to GDP ratio predicts lower GDP growth and higher unemployment in the medium run for an unbalanced panel of 30 countries from 1960 to 2012. Low mortgage spreads are associated with an increase in the household debt to GDP ratio and a decline in subsequent GDP growth, highlighting the importance of credit supply shocks. Economic forecasters systematically over-predict GDP growth at the end of household debt booms, suggesting an important role of flawed expectations formation. The negative relation between the change in household debt to GDP and subsequent output growth is stronger for countries with less flexible exchange rate regimes. We also uncover a global household debt cycle that partly predicts the severity of the global growth slowdown after 2007. Countries with a household debt cycle more correlated with the global household debt cycle experience a sharper decline in growth after an increase in domestic household debt.},

	volume = {33},
	abstract = {Despite recent progress in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), explaining predictions made by GNNs remains a challenging open problem. The leading method independently addresses the local explanations (i.e., important subgraph structure and node features) to interpret why a GNN model makes the prediction for a single instance, e.g. a node or a graph. As a result, the explanation generated is painstakingly customized for each instance. The unique explanation interpreting each instance independently is not sufﬁcient to provide a global understanding of the learned GNN model, leading to the lack of generalizability and hindering it from being used in the inductive setting. Besides, as it is designed for explaining a single instance, it is challenging to explain a set of instances naturally (e.g., graphs of a given class). In this study, we address these key challenges and propose PGExplainer, a parameterized explainer for GNNs. PGExplainer adopts a deep neural network to parameterize the generation process of explanations, which enables PGExplainer a natural approach to explaining multiple instances collectively. Compared to the existing work, PGExplainer has better generalization ability and can be utilized in an inductive setting easily. Experiments on both synthetic and real-life datasets show highly competitive performance with up to 24.7\% relative improvement in AUC on explaining graph classiﬁcation over the leading baseline.},

The tests are developed for a high-dimensional regime, are robust to model selection mistakes and do not require commonly assumed minimum signal strength. The testing procedures are based on a high dimensional, debiasing-free moment estimator, which uses a novel kernel smoothed Kendall’s tau correlation matrix as an input statistic. The estimator consistently estimates the latent inverse Pearson correlation matrix uniformly in both the index variable and kernel bandwidth. Its rate of convergence is shown to be minimax optimal. Our method is supported by thorough numerical simulations and an application to a neural imaging data set.},

	abstract = {In this paper we review sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, or particle ﬁlters (PF), with special emphasis on its potential applications in ﬁnancial time series analysis and econometrics. We start with the well-known normal dynamic linear model, also known as the normal linear state space model, for which sequential state learning is available in closed form via standard Kalman ﬁlter and Kalman smoother recursions. Particle ﬁlters are then introduced as a set of Monte Carlo schemes that enable Kalman-type recursions when normality or linearity or both are abandoned. The seminal bootstrap ﬁlter (BF) of Gordon, Salmond and Smith (1993) is used to introduce the SMC jargon, potentials and limitations. We also review the literature on parameter learning, an area that started to attract much attention from the particle ﬁlter community in recent years. We give particular attention to the Liu–West ﬁlter (2001), Storvik ﬁlter (2002) and particle learning (PL) of Carvalho, Johannes, Lopes and Polson (2010). We argue that the BF and the auxiliary particle ﬁlter (APF) of Pitt and Shephard (1999) deﬁne two fundamentally distinct directions within the particle ﬁlter literature. We also show that the distinction is more pronounced with parameter learning and argue that PL, which follows the APF direction, is an attractive extension. One of our contributions is to sort out the research from BF to APF (during the 1990s), from APF to now (the 2000s) and from Liu–West ﬁlter to Storvik ﬁlter to PL. To this end, we provide code in R for all the examples of the paper. Readers are invited to ﬁnd their own way into this dynamic and active research arena. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this survey we fill these gaps by devising a systematic experimental study, which tests 12 explainers on eight representative message-passing architectures trained on six carefully designed graph and node classification datasets. With our results we provide key insights on the choice and applicability of GNN explainers, we isolate key components that make them usable and successful and provide recommendations on how to avoid common interpretation pitfalls.

	abstract = {Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending markets have witnessed remarkable growth, revolutionizing the way borrowers and lenders interact. Despite the increasing popularity of P2P lending, it poses significant challenges related to credit risk assessment and default prediction with meaningful implications for financial stability. Traditional credit risk models have been widely employed in the field of P2P lending; however, they may not be capable to capture latent factor information inherent to a loan network based on similarity distances. Thus, in this study we propose an enhanced two-step modeling approach for Machine Learning (ML) that utilizes insights from network analysis and subsequently combines derived network centrality metrics with traditional credit risk factors to improve the prediction accuracy in the credit default prediction process. Through a comparative analysis of three classical ML models with varying degrees of complexity, namely Elastic Net (EN), Random Forest (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), we showcase novel evidence that the systematic inclusion of network topology features in the credit scoring process can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of the scoring models. Additional robustness tests via the inclusion of randomly shuffled centrality metrics in the analysis, and a further comparison of the graph-based models against a pertinent state-of-the-art credit scoring model in form of XGBoost, further confirm our results. The insights from this study bear valuable conclusions for P2P lending platforms to further improve their scoring systems with graph-enhanced metrics, thereby reducing default risk and facilitating greater access to credit.},

We find heterogeneity in the speed of adjustment by lender experience, investment size, and diversification strategies.

	abstract = {An extensive literature in economics and finance has documented home bias, the tendency that transactions are more likely to occur between parties in the same geographical area rather than outside. Using data from a large online crowdfunding marketplace and employing a quasi-experimental design, we find evidence that home bias still exists in this virtual marketplace for financial products. Furthermore, through a series of empirical tests, we show that rationality-based explanations cannot fully explain such behavior and that behavioral reasons at least partially drive this remarkable phenomenon. As crowdfunding becomes an alternative and increasingly appealing channel for financing, a better understanding of home bias in this new context provides important managerial, practical, and policy implications.

Using the proposed model, we conduct an empirical study on a dataset comprising of default events during the period from 1996 to 2006. In this study, those ﬁrms experienced bankruptcy/liquidation events as deﬁned by the Compustat database are classiﬁed as “defaulted” ﬁrms, whereas all other ﬁrms listed in the Fortune 500 with over a B-rating during the same time period are identiﬁed as “survived” ﬁrms. The empirical ﬁndings of this study are consistent with the following notions. The distance-to-default (DD) variable derived from the market-based model is statistically signiﬁcant in explaining the observed default events, particularly of those ﬁrms with relatively poor credit quality (i.e., high credit risk). Conversely, the z-score obtained with the accounting-ratio-based approach is statistically signiﬁcant in predicting bankruptcies of ﬁrms of relatively good credit quality (i.e., low credit risk). In-sample and out-of-sample bankruptcy prediction tests demonstrated the superior performance of utilizing dynamic loadings rather than constant loadings derived by the conventional logit model.},

	abstract = {Abstract
Web-based financial intermediation on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis will eventually prevail as an economically superior form of organisation compared to the traditional banking business model. P2P lending is the most popular type of crowdfunding, whereby an internet platform collects small amounts of funds from individuals in a crowd to finance collectively a larger loan to individuals or businesses. Unlike a commercial bank, the platform does not take risks through its own contractual positions. Whereas banks accumulate risks by taking positions on their balance sheet, platforms decentralise the risks by spreading them to their users. The emergence of financial platform businesses challenges legislators and regulators in several respects: the “easy way” of modifying existing finance and banking laws is inadequate; the internal organisation and knowledge of staff is not well suited to regulating crowdfunding; and capital mediation by crowdfunding platforms requires a different regulatory approach than banking. Finally, there is no doubt that P2P lending platforms will in the long run need a dedicated, single European regulatory framework.},

	abstract = {The massive price bubbles of decentralized cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have created a puzzle for economists. How can a non-revenue-generating asset exhibit such extreme price dynamics, forming multiple episodes of bubbles and crashes since its creation? The answer is not straightforward, since cryptocurrencies diﬀer in several important aspects from other conventional assets. In this paper, we investigate how key features associated with the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism aﬀect pricing. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we observe that the formation of price bubbles can be causally attributed to mining. Moreover, bubbles are more pronounced if the mining capacity is centralized to a small group of individuals. Analysis of the order book data reveals that miners seem to play a crucial role in bubble formation. The results demonstrate that high price volatility is an inherent feature of cryptocurrencies based on a mining protocol, which seriously limits any prospects for such assets truly becoming a medium of exchange.},

After exploding its price twenty times just in the twelve months of 2017, the tone has changed dramatically in 2018 after major price corrections and increasing concerns about its mining power consumption and overall sustainability. The dynamics and interaction between Bitcoin price and its mining costs have become of major interest. Here we show that these two quantities are tightly interconnected and they tend to a common long-term equilibrium. Mining costs adjust to the cryptocurrency price with the adjustment time of several months up to a year. Current developments suggest that we have arrived at a new era of Bitcoin mining where marginal (electricity) costs and mining eﬃciency play the prime role. Presented results open new avenues towards interpreting past and predicting future developments of the Bitcoin mining framework and their main possible directions are outlined and discussed here as well.},

This study proposes a bankruptcy prediction model for SMEs that uses transactional data and payment network–based variables under a scenario where no financial (accounting) data are required. Offline and online test results both confirmed the predictive capability and economic benefit of transactional data–based variables. However, incorporating those features in predictive models produces high dimensional problems, which deteriorates model interpretability and increases feature acquisition costs. Thus, we propose a two-stage multiobjective feature-selection method that optimizes the number of features as well as model classification performance. The results showed that the proposed model achieved similar classification perfor­ mance while greatly reducing the cardinality of the feature subset. Finally, the feature importance evaluation for features in the optimal subset confirmed the importance of transactional data and payment network-based variables for bankruptcy prediction.},

However, maximum-likelihood estimation has required approximation. Recent advances in multimove Gibbs sampling methodology open the way to approximation-free inference in such non-Gaussian, nonlinear models. This paper estimates the model for U.S. data and attempts to address three questions: Are both features of the business cycle empirically relevant? Might the implied new index of coincident indicators be a useful one in practice? Do the resulting estimates of regime switches show evidence of duration dependence?

@article{johansen_crashes_2000,
	title = {Crashes as {Critical} {Points}},
	volume = {3},
	abstract = {We study a rational expectation model of bubbles and crashes. The model has two components : (1) our key assumption is that a crash may be caused by local self-reinforcing imitation between noise traders. If the tendency for noise traders to imitate their nearest neighbors increases up to a certain point called the ``critical'' point, all noise traders may place the same order (sell) at the same time, thus causing a crash. The interplay between the progressive strengthening of imitation and the ubiquity of noise is characterized by the hazard rate, i.e. the probability per unit time that the crash will happen in the next instant if it has not happened yet. (2) Since the crash is not a certain deterministic outcome of the bubble, it remains rational for traders to remain invested provided they are compensated by a higher rate of growth of the bubble for taking the risk of a crash. Our model distinguishes between the end of the bubble and the time of the crash,: the rational expectation constraint has the specific implication that the date of the crash must be random. The theoretical death of the bubble is not the time of the crash because the crash could happen at any time before, even though this is not very likely. The death of the bubble is the most probable time for the crash. There also exists a finite probability of attaining the end of the bubble without crash. Our model has specific predictions about the presence of certain critical log-periodic patterns in pre-crash prices, associated with the deterministic components of the bubble mechanism. We provide empirical evidence showing that these patterns were indeed present before the crashes of 1929, 1962 and 1987 on Wall Street and the 1997 crash on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. These results are compared with statistical tests on synthetic data.},

In light of these developments, we observe the rapid changes in cryptocurrency market prices, trends, and regulatory policies, which drive us to conduct a comprehensive review of cryptocurrencies asset's literature and examine its robustness. Our study covers several themes: how cryptocurrencies fit into broader asset allocation strategies, techniques to create crypto-based indexes, current debates over speculative bubbles, and the evolution of valuation models to highlight the dual aspects of market opportunities and risks. Throughout our review, we compare previous studies with the latest data, seeking to determine which arguments continue to hold up and which require adjustment. Although digital assets have experienced multiple crashes, they often rebound more strongly than expected, making them a topic of intense debate among academics, regulators, and investors.

Have fintech firms expanded credit access, or are their customers similar to those of traditional lenders? Unlike in small business and unsecured consumers lending, fintech mortgage lenders do not have the same incentives or flexibility to use alternative data for credit decisions because of stringent mortgage origination requirements. Fintech loans are broadly similar to those made by traditional lenders, despite innovations in the marketing and the application process. However, nonbanks market to consumers with weaker credit scores than do banks, and fintech lenders have greater market shares in areas with lower credit scores and higher mortgage denial rates.},

            We show that negative policy rates affect the supply of bank credit in a novel way. Banks are reluctant to pass on negative rates to depositors, which increases the funding cost of high-deposit banks, and reduces their net worth, relative to low-deposit banks. As a consequence, the introduction of negative policy rates by the European Central Bank in mid-2014 leads to more risk-taking and less lending by euro-area banks with a greater reliance on deposit funding. Our results suggest that negative rates are less accommodative and could pose a risk to financial stability, if lending is done by high-deposit banks.

More importantly, failing platforms were much less likely to run off in advance of major political events, but more likely to declare bankruptcy or run off after such events. These effects are more pronounced for politically connected platforms, platforms oper­ ating in provinces where local officials have close ties with central government, and in provinces with better local financial conditions. Our study highlights the role of political incentives on government regulatory intervention in platform failures.},

P2P lending platforms perform the brokerage function of ﬁnancial intermediaries by matching lenders’ supply and borrowers’ demand of funding, according to the risk and the maturity of their needs. Unlike banks, P2P lending platforms do not create money and do not perform risk and maturity transformation. However, they can organize secondary markets to trade loan contracts before maturity and some P2P lending platforms aim at providing a ﬁxed income to lenders. To ensure efﬁcient and sustainable ﬁnancial intermediation, P2P lending platforms need to ensure that they are not subject to principal-agent problems and that their incentives coincide with those of lenders. The possibility of orderly resolution of P2P lending platforms failures might decrease moral hazard problems that are inherent in the modern ﬁnancial intermediation.},

These findings provide valuable insights for regulators and investors into NFT bubble dynamics, cryptocurrency price behaviour, and market sentiment, facilitating informed decision-making.},

This evolution is characterized by expanded connectivity and enhanced speed of information processing both at the customer interface and in back-ofﬁce processes. Recently, there has been a shift in the focus of digitalization from improving the delivery of traditional tasks to introducing fundamentally new business opportunities and models for ﬁnancial service companies. Digital Finance encompasses a magnitude of new ﬁnancial products, ﬁnancial businesses, ﬁnance-related software, and novel forms of customer communication and interaction—delivered by FinTech companies and innovative ﬁnancial service providers. Against this backdrop, the research on ﬁnance and information systems has started to analyze these changes and the impact of digital progress on the ﬁnancial sector. Therefore, this article reviews the current state of research in Digital Finance that deals with these novel and innovative business functions. Moreover, it gives an outlook on potential future research directions.

In the context of credit services, ﬁntech peer to peer lenders have introduced many opportunities, among which improved speed, better customer experience, and reduced costs. However, peer-to-peer lending platforms lead to higher risks, among which higher credit risk: not owned by the lenders, and systemic risks: due to the high interconnectedness among borrowers generated by the platform. This calls for new and more accurate credit risk models to protect consumers and preserve ﬁnancial stability. In this paper we propose to enhance credit risk accuracy of peer-to-peer platforms by leveraging topological information embedded into similarity networks, derived from borrowers’ ﬁnancial information. Topological coefﬁcients describing borrowers’ importance and community structures are employed as additional explanatory variables, leading to an improved predictive performance of credit scoring models.},

The main contribution is twofold: to provide some experimental insights about the behavior of the variable importance index based on random forests and to propose a strategy involving a ranking of explanatory variables using the random forests score of importance and a stepwise ascending variable introduction strategy.},

Using meta-analysis techniques, we summarise the results of a common empirical framework based on confidential bank-loan data. The main conclusions are that (i) macroprudential policies have been quite effective in stabilising credit cycles. The propagation of the effects to credit growth is more rapid for policies aimed at curbing the cycle than for policies aimed at fostering resilience; and (ii) macroprudential tools have a greater effect on credit growth when reinforced by the use of monetary policy.},

	volume = {15},
	abstract = {Risk assessment of ﬁnancial intermediaries is an area of renewed interest due to the ﬁnancial crises of the 1980’s and 90’s. An accurate estimation of risk, and its use in corporate or global ﬁnancial risk models, could be translated into a more efﬁcient use of resources. One important ingredient to accomplish this goal is to ﬁnd accurate predictors of individual risk in the credit portfolios of institutions. In this context we make a comparative analysis of different statistical and machine learning modeling methods of classiﬁcation on a mortgage loan data set with the motivation to understand their limitations and potential. We introduced a speciﬁc modeling methodology based on the study of error curves. Using state-of-the-art modeling techniques we built more than 9,000 models as part of the study. The results show that CART decision-tree models provide the best estimation for default with an average 8.31\% error rate for a training sample of 2,000 records. As a result of the error curve analysis for this model we conclude that if more data were available, approximately 22,000 records, a potential 7.32\% error rate could be achieved. Neural Networks provided the second best results with an average error of 11.00\%. The K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm had an average error rate of 14.95\%. These results outperformed the standard Probit algorithm which attained an average error rate of 15.13\%. Finally we discuss the possibilities to use this type of accurate predictive model as ingredients of institutional and global risk models.},

            Lending marketplaces aimed at directly connecting retail lenders and borrowers retreat from auctions and, instead, set prices and allocate credit on their own, despite evidence that retail investors possess valuable soft and nonstandard information. We investigate this puzzle by analyzing a unique data set of 7,455 auctions and 34 million bids from a leading British peer-to-business platform. We find that the platform was vulnerable to liquidity shocks, resulting in sizable deviations from information efficiency. Deviations increased over time because of a growing role played by noncrowd players, particularly large investors and algorithms.},

A range of methods and performance metrics are used to benchmark predictive performance, based on a large dataset of P2P loans issued on Lending Club. Robust linear mixed models are used to investigate performance differences between models, according to whether they assume linearity, whether they build ensembles, and which types of predictors they use. The main ﬁndings are that: linear methods perform surprisingly well on several (but not all) criteria; whether ensemble methods perform better than individual methods is measure dependent; the use of alternative text-based information does not improve proﬁt scoring outcomes. We conclude that P2P lenders could potentially increase their investment returns by applying linear methods that directly predict the internal rate of return instead of other dependent variables such as loan default.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a Projected Principal Component Analysis (Projected-PCA), which employees principal component analysis to the projected (smoothed) data matrix onto a given linear space spanned by covariates. When it applies to high-dimensional factor analysis, the projection removes noise components. We show that the unobserved latent factors can be more accurately estimated than the conventional PCA if the projection is genuine, or more precisely, when the factor loading matrices are related to the projected linear space. When the dimensionality is large, the factors can be estimated accurately even when the sample size is finite. We propose a flexible semi-parametric factor model, which decomposes the factor loading matrix into the component that can be explained by subject-specific covariates and the orthogonal residual component. The covariates’ effects on the factor loadings are further modeled by the additive model via sieve approximations. By using the newly proposed Projected-PCA, the rates of convergence of the smooth factor loading matrices are obtained, which are much faster than those of the conventional factor analysis. The convergence is achieved even when the sample size is finite and is particularly appealing in the high-dimension-low-sample-size situation. This leads us to developing nonparametric tests on whether observed covariates have explaining powers on the loadings and whether they fully explain the loadings. The proposed method is illustrated by both simulated data and the returns of the components of the S\&P 500 index.},

We find that credit grade, debt-to-income ratio, FICO score and revolving line utilization play an important role in loan defaults. Loans with lower credit grade and longer duration are associated with high mortality rate. The result is consistent with the Cox Proportional Hazard test which suggests that the hazard rate or the likelihood of the loan default increases with the credit risk of the borrowers. Finally, we find that higher interest rates charged on the high-risk borrowers are not enough to compensate for higher probability of the loan default. The Lending Club must find ways to attract high FICO score and high-income borrowers in order to sustain their businesses.},

A spillover index shows only limited volatility transmission effects between cryptocurrencies and NFTs. But wavelet coherence analysis indicates co-movement between the two sets of markets. This suggests that cryptocurrency pricing behaviours might be of some benefit in understanding NFT pricing patterns.

Alternative infor­ mation could improve the models, but our analysis could not confirm this benefit of the platform. The average internal rate of return on closed transactions was –4.17\%, and 42\% of the loans end with a negative IRR.

Using a rich data set of credit offers from Mintel, in conjunction with credit information from TransUnion and other consumer credit data from the FRBNY/Equifax Consumer Credit Panel, we compare similar credit offers that were made by banks, fintech firms, and other nonbank lenders. Fintech firms are more likely than banks to offer mortgage credit to consumers with lower income, lower-credit scores, and those who have been denied credit in the recent past. Fintechs are also more likely than banks to offer personal loans to consumers who had filed for bankruptcy (thus also more likely to receive credit card offers overall) and those who had recently been denied credit. For both personal loans and mortgage loans, fintech firms are more likely than other lenders to reach out and offer credit to nonprime consumers.},

Based on a representative panel dataset that comprises private ﬁrms from all major industries, we ﬁnd that business credit information sharing substantially improves the quality of default predictions. The improvement is stronger for older ﬁrms and those with limited liability, and depends on the sharing of ﬁrms’ payment history and the number of ﬁrms covered by the local credit bureau ofﬁce. The value of soft business credit information is higher the smaller the ﬁrms and the lower their distance from the local credit bureau ofﬁce. Furthermore, in spatial and industry analyses we show that the higher the value of business credit information the lower the realized default rates.

            We study the personal credit market using unique individual-level data covering fintech and traditional lenders. We show that fintech lenders acquire market share by lending first to higher-risk borrowers and then to safer borrowers, and rely mainly on hard information to make credit decisions. Fintech borrowers are significantly more likely to default than neighbor individuals with the same characteristics borrowing from traditional financial institutions. Furthermore, they tend to experience a short-lived reduction in the cost of credit, because their indebtedness increases more than non-fintech borrowers after loan origination. However, fintech lenders’ pricing strategies are likely to take this into account.},

            We derive three testable predictions from a bank-P2P lender model of competition: (a) P2P lending grows when some banks are faced with exogenously higher regulatory costs; (b) P2P loans are riskier than bank loans; and (c) the risk-adjusted interest rates on P2P loans are lower than those on bank loans. We test these predictions against data on P2P loans and the consumer bank credit market in Germany and find empirical support. Overall, our analysis indicates that P2P lenders are bottom fishing, especially when regulatory shocks create a competitive disadvantage for some banks. (JEL G21)},

Initial results relate to the application of cointegration techniques to provide long and short run estimates of the key determinants of credit spreads. The analysis is then extended to allow for an unobservable latent variable Markov Switching speciﬁcation across two separate states. Finally a deterministic regime model based upon an inﬂation threshold is estimated demonstrating that key causal relationships exist independently across different inﬂationary environments.},

Maintaining a factor model structure allows us to easily derive the asset expected returns and their corresponding covariance matrix. By design, these two parameters are calibrated to better describe the properties of the diﬀerent market regimes. In turn, these regime-dependent parameters serve as the inputs during mean–variance optimization, thereby constructing portfolios adapted to the current market environment. Through this formulation, the proposed model allows for the construction of large, realistic portfolios at no additional computational cost during optimization. Moreover, the viability of this model can be signiﬁcantly improved by periodically rebalancing the portfolio, ensuring proper alignment between the estimated parameters and the transient market regimes. An out-of-sample computational experiment over a long investment horizon shows that the proposed regime-dependent portfolios are better aligned with the market environment, yielding a higher ex-post rate of return and lower volatility, even when compared against competing portfolios.},

The main result is that fintech credit shows a lower (even non-significant) reactivity to monetary policy shocks in comparison to traditional bank credit.

Fintech credit offers an alternative funding source for businesses and consumers, and may improve access to credit for underserved segments. It may enhance the efficiency of financial intermediation. However, as shown by some failures and conduct problems, it also gives rise to a number of challenges for regulators. Many of these are centred on ensuring adequate consumer and investor protection.

This paper investigates the dynamic volume–return relationship of the five largest decentralised finance tokens, to better understand this relationship given the similarities with cryptocurrencies and the possible benefits for traders and practitioners. We implement the quantile-on-quantile regression and an extreme value theory approach to examine the relationship between the daily returns of the prices and trading volumes of decentralised finance tokens at varying quantiles and at the extreme tails. Our results suggest that when trading volume is experiencing large increases, the returns of the prices of tokens appear to be significantly positive for some cases but negative for others. The extreme volume-return dependence is found to be asymmetric in the extreme negative and positive tails of the distributions, where the dependence below extreme negative thresholds is essentially non-existent but above extreme positive thresholds it is significant. This asymmetric extreme dependence between returns and volume may be beneficial for developing trading strategies that incorporate trading volume data, and may indicate an inefficient market.},

By implementing machine learning methods, we measure the likelihood of success for loan resale on Bondora’s secondary market and compare our predictions with the ex-post market outcomes. The differences observed uncover two phenomena which are related to the diverging perceptions of market participants on asset prices and asso­ ciated fundamentals: some non-saleable assets are sold, while the resale of highly saleable assets is not successful. Sellers’ pricing behaviour changes once they observe buyers’ actions revealing the buyers’ beliefs about the value of the asset. Our results are robust to various statistical and machine learning methods.},

Such a problem tends to arise when the idiosyncratic errors are cross-correlated. It can also arise if forecasting power is provided by a factor that is dominant in a small dataset but is a dominated factor in a larger dataset. In a real time forecasting exercise, we ﬁnd that factors extracted from as few as 40 pre-screened series often yield satisfactory or even better results than using all 147 series. Weighting the data by their properties when constructing the factors also lead to improved forecasts. Our simulation analysis is unique in that special attention is paid to cross-correlated idiosyncratic errors, and we also allow the factors to have stronger loadings on some groups of series than others. It thus allows us to better understand the properties of the principal components estimator in empirical applications.},

The platforms use cryptocurrencies as collateral, matching speculative margin traders with yield-seeking depositors. Depositors receive claims guaranteed by a basket of collateral. We develop a framework that requires only knowledge of total deposits and borrowings to measure the total protocol risk to lenders and borrowers. Using data from major protocols, the risk measures show that system fragility increased beyond reasonable levels around mid-2021, and we identify time periods exposing lenders to a potential collateral loss conditional on continuing extreme fluctuations in coin prices. Moreover, our results indicate that the liquidation process, a risk mitigation strategy, is not timely and is less effective when risk levels are high. Overall, the model provides two easily implementable aggregate risk metrics that capture the perspectives of synthetic investors and provide early warning signals as the industry moves from collateral-guaranteed deposits to fiat money.},

Thereafter, we study the sentiment-price return connection and its concordance with periods of existing bubbles. Our results show the existence of multiple bubble regimes in the virtual market and more specifically, a huge bubble occurring during the crypto-market bull phase for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and CRIX. Moreover, we find that the bubbles that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic concord with periods of high sentiment co-movement with the three markets. Hence, some of those bubble periods are in phases with periods of high co-movement with sentiments toward different markets. In addition, the fear and greed toward the crypto-market seem to be the leading sentiment index that highly influences the crypto-market components and their bubble appearances.},

In this speciﬁc context, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has acquired an increasing importance, with a larger share of loans having been originated through P2P platforms instead of traditional banking channels. This trend has been welcomed by policy makers as a move towards alternative market-based ﬁnance, which should contribute to better risk diversiﬁcation by moving risks away from systemic ﬁnancial institutions. At the same time, this shift presents a number of regulatory questions that have remained largely unexplored. This is so because the nature and role of P2P platforms have remained loosely deﬁned, which means that it has been difﬁcult to identify relevant regulatory challenges emerging from these channels of ﬁnance. This research tackles two interrelated questions. First, it addresses the conceptual redeﬁnition of ﬁnancial intermediation. This enables understanding of the function of P2P platforms, and whether they have supplemented the intermediation role traditionally conducted by banks. Secondly, it explores the risks that arise in connection with P2P lending channels. This second enquiry highlights outstanding policy and regulatory issues that have remained unexplored or downplayed in current debates.},

Specifically, we consider Lending Club with 1,169,976 individual loans and 128 variables, Prosper with 386,685 loans and 142 variables, and Zopa with 440,493 loans and 192 variables. Using linear and threshold regressions, we observe three main findings: (i) accounting for the macroeconomic environment systematically improves our understanding of the variation in the future performance of individual loans; (ii) demand-side variables, particularly the unemployment rate and industrial production, have stronger effects as supply-side and economic uncertainty variables; and (iii) the importance (effect size) of the macroeconomic environment is at least at the level of that of calendar and geographic variables but much smaller than the importance of loan or borrower characteristics.

            We study the broad question about the sources of FinTech lending growth by examining a specific representative product for which the technologies of both FinTech and the incumbent competitors can be identified and compared—small business lending. We test whether the presence of incumbents employing different technologies affects FinTech penetration, and find more FinTech lending where large/out-of-market banks are more prevalent. Using stress test exposures and Community Reinvestment Act examinations as instruments, we find that FinTech credit more often substitutes for loans by large/out-of-market banks than small/in-market banks. Results are consistent with FinTech advantages in processing hard information, rather than hardening soft information. (JEL G21, G23, O33)},

We then propose some panel criteria and show that the number of factors can be consistently estimated using the criteria. The theory is developed under the framework of large crosssections (N ) and large time dimensions (T ). No restriction is imposed on the relation between N and T .

            We identify flight-to-safety (FTS) days for twenty-three countries using only stock and bond returns and a model averaging approach. FTS days comprise less than 2\% of the sample and are associated with a 2.7\% average bond-equity return differential and significant flows out of equity funds and into government bond and money market funds. FTS represents flights to both quality and liquidity in international equity markets, but mainly a flight to quality in the U.S. corporate bond market. Emerging markets, endowment funds, and hedge funds perform poorly during FTS, whereas hedge funds appear to vary their systematic exposures prior to an FTS.

In empirical estimates, the means, volatilities, autocorrelations, and cross-covariances of asset returns often differ across regimes in a manner that allows regime-switching models to capture the stylized behavior of many financial series including fat tails, heteroskedasticity, skewness, and time-varying correlations. In equilibrium models, regimes in fundamental processes, such as consumption or dividend growth, strongly affect the dynamic properties of equilibrium asset prices and can induce nonlinear risk-return trade-offs.

Equity hedge ratios are three or four times larger during the turbulent period, which explains why previous research on single-regime models ﬁnds stock positions to be ineﬀective hedges for default swaps.

            We propose a new approach to studying the pass-through of credit expansion policies that focuses on frictions, such as asymmetric information, that arise in the interaction between banks and borrowers. We decompose the effect of changes in banks’ cost of funds on aggregate borrowing into the product of banks’ marginal propensity to lend (MPL) to borrowers and those borrowers’ marginal propensity to borrow (MPB), aggregated over all borrowers in the economy. We apply our framework by estimating heterogeneous MPBs and MPLs in the U.S. credit card market. Using panel data on 8.5 million credit cards and 743 credit limit regression discontinuities, we find that the MPB is declining in credit score, falling from 59\% for consumers with FICO scores below 660 to essentially zero for consumers with FICO scores above 740. We use a simple model of optimal credit limits to show that a bank’s MPL depends on a small number of parameters that can be estimated using our credit limit discontinuities. For the lowest FICO score consumers, higher credit limits sharply reduce profits from lending, limiting banks’ optimal MPL to these consumers. The negative correlation between MPB and MPL reduces the impact of changes in banks’ cost of funds on aggregate household borrowing, and highlights the importance of frictions in bank-borrower interactions for understanding the pass-through of credit expansions.},

              Principal component analysis (PCA) is a multivariate technique that analyzes a data table in which observations are described by several inter‐correlated quantitative dependent variables. Its goal is to extract the important information from the table, to represent it as a set of new orthogonal variables called principal components, and to display the pattern of similarity of the observations and of the variables as points in maps. The quality of the PCA model can be evaluated using cross‐validation techniques such as the bootstrap and the jackknife. PCA can be generalized as
              correspondence analysis
              (CA) in order to handle qualitative variables and as
              multiple factor analysis
              (MFA) in order to handle heterogeneous sets of variables. Mathematically, PCA depends upon the eigen‐decomposition of positive semi‐definite matrices and upon the singular value decomposition (SVD) of rectangular matrices.

The Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) as well as the Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) methodology are the most frequently employed techniques for bubble detection and measurement. Based on much academic research, Bitcoin appears to have been in a bubble-phase since June 2015, while Ethereum, NEM, Stellar, Ripple, Litecoin and Dash have been denoted as possessing bubble-like characteristics since September 2015. However, this latter group possess little academic evidence supporting the presence of bubbles since early 2018.

	abstract = {We present the Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB), a collection of challenging and diverse benchmark datasets for realistic, reproducible, and robust evaluation of machine learning models on temporal graphs. TGB datasets are of large scale, spanning years in duration, incorporate both node and edge-level prediction tasks and cover a diverse set of domains including social, trade, transaction, and transportation networks. For both tasks, we design evaluation protocols based on realistic use-cases. We extensively benchmark each dataset and find that the performance of common models can vary drastically across datasets. In addition, on dynamic node property prediction tasks, we show that simple methods often achieve superior performance compared to existing temporal graph models. We believe that these findings open up opportunities for future research on temporal graphs. Finally, TGB provides an automated machine learning pipeline for reproducible and accessible temporal graph research, including data loading, experiment setup and performance evaluation. TGB will be maintained and updated on a regular basis and welcomes community feedback. TGB datasets, data loaders, example codes, evaluation setup, and leaderboards are publicly available at https://tgb.complexdatalab.com/.},

As the pandemic adversely affects financial markets globally, a better understanding of the dynamics of successful P2P lending is necessary under the conditions of financial distress. By using the cross-country database of secondary market listing outcomes at Bondora (Estonia) and employing probit, ordered probit and tobit regression methods, we provide evidence of the pandemic-induced exposure to liquidity risk in the P2P lending market. Despite increased volatility in the financial markets, results show that COVID-19 risk increases the probability of successful listing during the pandemic. However, this outcome comes at significant liquidation costs for investors in the form of higher premiums. Further analysis based on listing outcomes and loan characteristics shows a negative association between COVID-19 risk and share of overdue loans and average overdue days in secondary market listings. Simultaneously, more experienced investors dominate the market as COVID-19 risk increases, a trend that is reflected in shorter listing times. The findings of this study imply certain early tendencies in financial markets during pandemic-induced turmoil and open new avenues for further research.},

The “MPC out of liquidity” is largest for people starting near their limit, consistent with binding liquidity constraints. However, the MPC is significant even for people starting well below their limit, consistent with precautionary models. Nonetheless, there are other results that conventional models cannot easily explain, for example, why so many people are borrowing on their credit cards, and simultaneously holding low yielding assets. The long-run elasticity of debt to the interest rate is approximately -1.3, less than half of which represents balance-shifting across cards.},

	abstract = {Credit risk assessment plays a key role for correctly supporting financial institutes in defining their bank policies and commercial strategies. Over the last decade, the emerging of social lending platforms has disrupted traditional services for credit risk assessment. Through these platforms, lenders and borrowers can easily interact among them without any involvement of financial institutes. In particular, they support borrowers in the fundraising process, enabling the participation of any number and size of lenders. However, the lack of lenders’ experience and missing or uncertain information about borrower’s credit history can increase risks in social lending platforms, requiring an accurate credit risk scoring. To overcome such issues, the credit risk assessment problem of financial operations is usually modeled as a binary problem on the basis of debt’s repayment and proper machine learning techniques can be consequently exploited. In this paper, we propose a benchmarking study of some of the most used credit risk scoring models to predict if a loan will be repaid in a P2P platform. We deal with a class imbalance problem and leverage several classifiers among the most used in the literature, which are based on different sampling techniques. A real social lending platform (Lending Club) data-set, composed by 877,956 samples, has been used to perform the experimental analysis considering different evaluation metrics (i.e. AUC, Sensitivity, Specificity), also comparing the obtained outcomes with respect to the state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, the three best approaches have also been evaluated in terms of their explainability by means of different eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tools.},

We show that P2P lending is servicing a slice of the consumer credit market neglected by banks, namely highrisk and small-sized loans. Nevertheless, when accounting for the risk diﬀerential, interest rates are very similar. Our conclusion is that P2P lending is substituting the banking sector for high-risk consumer loans since banks are unwilling or unable to supply this slice of the market. Our study serves to show where the institutionalization of credit provision has left a slice of the market unsupplied.},

Using data from the Lending Club, we explore the characteristics of loan and its applicant and use random forest to do the feature selection in the modeling phase. The Difference from other risk prediction models is that the prediction is classified into three or four categories, rather than just two the default and not default classes. Then we compare five DM models: two decision trees (DTs), two neural networks (NNs) and one support vector machine (SVM) and use two metrics: average percent hit rate and area of the lift cumulative curve to evaluate the prediction results. The Empirical result shows that the term of loan, annual income, the amount of loan, debt-to-income ratio, credit grade and revolving line utilization play an important role in loan defaults. And SVM, Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Multilayer perceptron (MPL)’s prediction performance are almost equal.},

Along with the rapid expansion of big fintech companies, the possibility of financial risk breeding and spreading in the New Relational Network is also rising. This article analyzes and simulates the risk contagion mechanism of big fintech risks based on the SIRS epidemic model. The study’s findings imply that: when the number of big fintech companies infected with risk exceeds the risk threshold, the big fintech risk will spread in the New Relational Network. At this time, the number of big fintech companies infected with risk can be reduced below the threshold by enhancing the risk warning, risk management, risk buffering and blocking capabilities, and timely improving risk prevention and control measures in the post-infection phase. It means that the big fintech risk is controlled. For big fintech risks, proactive interventions are more effective than post-incident response measures. This paper makes the following recommendations for preventing big fintech risks: creating a risk monitoring and early warning system to raise the Big Fintech companies’ direct immunization rates; strengthening the big fintech companies’ risk management and risk mitigation capabilities; enhancing the internal and external supervision to achieve sustainable development of big fintech companies.},

	abstract = {Internationally synchronized credit cycles have become a major challenge for monetary policy. On the national level, monetary authorities moved to unconventional monetary policy to control the credit cycle on a national level. We include in an inﬂation targeting model of the type developed by Svensson (1997) a nonlinear Phillips curve – allowing for a state-dependent relation of the inﬂation rate and the output gap – and add nonlinear dynamics for credit ﬂows and loan interest rate spreads. We solve such an extended monetary policy model and study the dynamic eﬀects of price oriented as well as credit volume oriented monetary policy variants. We estimate our nonlinear simultaneous equation system based on data for the euro area, to thereby inform the model parameters and explore, via simulations, the stabilizing destabilizing eﬀects of price (credit cost) and non-price (credit volume) policies. On the basis of a proposed small scale nonlinear quadratic (NLQ) model with two regime switches –similar to more complex large scale models – we can explicitly study the eﬀects of conventional and unconventional monetary policy for various economic scenarios with endogenous credit ﬂows, variation of risk premia, and credit spread movements, ﬁrst in the NLQ model and then through a regime switching VAR and corresponding impulse-responses.},

We consider that the ﬁnancial market is characterized by factors, and we present a regime-switching auto-regressive model for macro-economic factors to reﬂect ﬁnancial cycles. We then deﬁne a factor model for the distribution of asset returns, with returns depending on regimes through the factors. The dependence is on the regime sequence in successive periods, or the regime transition. The factor model structure is embedded in the asset expected returns and their corresponding covariance matrix. These regime-dependent parameters serve as the inputs to mean-variance optimization, thereby constructing portfolios adapted to the current market environment. A contrast between investment decisions based on the expectation over regimes or the selection of a single most likely (inferred) regime is provided. The improvements in portfolio performance are calibrated with market data on macroeconomic factors and exchange traded funds as investment instruments.},

In order to represent the speculative attack in the economy, the study utilized one of the measures that is most widely adopted to signal the breakup of a crisis, the Exchange Market Pressure Index (EMPI). This paper found the following. First, liquidity (DC), real exchange rate (RER2) and ratio of banking credit to GDP (BCred) were found to significantly influence the EMPI, indicating that the behavior of EMPI has the characteristic that is predicted by the first, second, and third generation of crisis model found to significantly influence the EMPI, indicating that the behavior of EMPI has the characteristic that is predicted by the first, second and third generation of crisis models. Second, the LR test showed that regime switching dynamic model is more robust than ordinary dynamic model in explaining the EMPI, suggesting that speculative attacks tend to have the characteristics of multiple equilibria. Third, the transition probability matrix results showed that the tranquility regime was more persistent than the volatile regime.},

	abstract = {This paper explores an explainable AI model in the financial industry. Macroeconomic and market data serve as inputs of Hierarchical Clustering to distinguish among different economic regimes. Compared with traditional models such as Investment Clock, this method can adjust the classification standard in time according to recent market sentiment. The regime, therefore, can be interpreted by not only macro indicators but also investors’ mood swings using Artificial Intelligence. When we compute the statistical characteristics of returns of each asset, we find that they can be well distinguished among regimes. This method can also identify the abnormally large wave of the stock market from 2015 to 2016 by separating it as an unusual regime, which cannot be realized by traditional methods. The clustering technique enables us to explain and understand the current market status and predict different assets’ performances. Therefore, thanks to the superior interpretability of AI, the mean and variance of returns in each regime are estimated and viewed as viewpoints of the Black-Litterman asset allocation model to construct portfolios. To simulate the real situation, a dynamic backtesting method is used and asset weights change because of the rolling time windows. The results show that equipped with a simple timing strategy, the clustering technique can improve the results and yield excess returns. Some other machine learning techniques are also applied in an attempt to improve the model.},

Applying panel local projections to state-level data, we, in a first step, investigate the dynamic effects of fiercer bank competition induced by deregulation allowing geographical expansion of banks across state borders in the 1980s and early-1990s. We allow for possible adjustments before the new laws became effective due to potential anticipation effects. Our findings suggest that these events were anticipated and that they temporarily increased economic activity as well as business and consumer lending. We also find a permanent increase in real estate lending and house prices. In a second step, we show that the impact of monetary policy on economic activity, house prices and lending tended to become stronger after interstate banking deregulation.},

	abstract = {Online consumer lending has recently been growing rapidly, but it faces high credit risk. For this problem, developing powerful credit scoring models has become an effective solution and can be achieved from three aspects: modeling approach, data source, and evaluation measure. This paper proposes a novel model that departs from those in previous studies in threefold. First, a heterogeneous deep forest model that combines deep learning architecture and treebased ensemble classifiers is proposed as the modeling approach. Second, a Bayesian-based macroeconomic variable optimization method is developed to determine the macroeconomic variables and the corresponding lag term, and the selected macroeconomic variables are used as supplementary data source for modeling. Lastly, a series of capital charge error measures is proposed to evaluate credit scoring models from a regulatory perspective. The proposal is evaluated on multiple large datasets under performance measures on predictive accuracy, profitability, and capital charge errors. Frequentist and Bayesian nonparametric significance tests are used to examine the statistical significance of heterogeneous deep forest and benchmarks. Three main conclusions can be reached from the comparison. First, heterogeneous deep forest significantly outperforms the industry benchmarks over all the evaluation measures. Second, the predictive performance is enhanced after incorporating the selected macroeconomic variables and the corresponding lag, and the result remains robust under cross-validation and forward-chaining validation. Third, the capital charge errors reflect the model performance from a regulatory perspective and thus lead to different rankings from those when evaluating predictive accuracy and profitability.},

We analyze a panel data set of mortgages originated between 2000 and 2009 and follow their performance up to 2014. After controlling for all of the usual observable effects, we show that a strong residual vintage effect remains. This vintage effect correlates well with consumer mortgage demand, as measured by the Federal Reserve Board’s Senior Loan Ofﬁcer Opinion Survey, and with changes in mortgage pricing at the time the loan was originated. Our ﬁndings are consistent with an economic environment in which the incentives of low-risk consumers to obtain a mortgage decrease when the cost of obtaining a loan rises. As a result, mortgage originators generate mortgages from a pool of consumers with changing risk proﬁles over the credit cycle. The unobservable component of the shift in credit risk, relative to the usual underwriting criteria, may be thought of as macroeconomic adverse selection.},

Permanent and transitory incomes play an intuitive role in these three dimensions of the credit card.

The probability of use is determined by the usury interest rate while monthly purchases are affected by the interest rate charged by the ﬁnancial institution and the usury interest rate, both indicative of the broad credit channel.

The results are robust to different empirical approaches. Results imply that it would be important for regulators to provide greater transparency in terms of guidance and regulatory clarity on which alternative data can be used legally without violating fair lending rules.

We find that (i) the feature importance in driving systemic risk depends on market conditions; namely, market volatility (MVOL), individual stock volatility (IVOL), and market capitalization (MC) are positive drivers of systemic risk under extreme (downside and upside) market conditions, while under normal market conditions, institutions with high price-earnings ratio, large MC, and low IVOL play an essential role in stabilizing markets; (ii) macroeconomic variables are the most important extreme systemic risk drivers, while firm characteristics are more important under normal market conditions; and (iii) the interaction between IVOL and MC or MVOL is the significant source of extreme systemic risk, and MC is the most crucial interaction attribute under normal market conditions. The interactions between macroeconomic variables are the most prominent in systemic risk under different market conditions.},

We find that a corporate digital transformation significantly reduces trade credit financing, and that this effect varies greatly among industries and enterprises. Furthermore, we identify asset specificity and bank credit as the mechanisms of this effect. Finally, we verify the effect of digital transformation on two dimensions: corporate innovation and value. Overall, these findings enrich research on digital transformation and trade credit financing, and provide important practical insights for enterprises to efficiently allocate their credit funds and reduce their financial risk through digital transformation.},

	abstract = {Enforcing an environmental protection tax is a pivotal institutional measure for addressing environmental and climate change challenges and marking a substantial advancement in ecological development. This study aims to explore the influence of environmental protection taxes on the “green” productivity of the manufacturing industry through an analysis of Chinese listed companies. Initially, the Dynamic Slacks-Based Measure (DSBM) method is employed to estimate the “green” production efficiency levels of 175 listed companies in China from 2016 to 2020. Subsequently, by aligning pollution tax standards issued by local governments and relevant environmental protection departments with microlevel data from the CSMAR database, wind database, listed company annual reports, and social responsibility reports, the sample was refined to 833 data points. Using the implementation of the environmental protection tax policy in 2018 as a natural experiment, a Difference-in-Differences (DID) model is applied for empirical testing. The empirical results reveal a counterintuitive negative correlation between the environmental protection tax and the “green” productivity of companies, contradicting the predictions of the Porter hypothesis. This suggests that stringent environmental regulations hinder the development of green technologies. The adverse impact of environmental protection taxes on “green” productivity is attributed to heightened environmental legitimacy pressures and increasing environmental uncertainty risks companies face. Further exploratory analysis indicated that the digital economy and green finance have a positive moderating effect, significantly mitigating the negative impact of environmental protection taxes on companies' overall “green” productivity. Consequently, dynamically optimizing environmental tax policies is imperative to alleviate companies' environmental legitimacy pressures and uncertainty risks. Additionally, capitalizing on the opportunities the digital economy presents and leveraging green finance policies have emerged as effective strategies for realizing the Porter effect of environmental protection taxes.},

	abstract = {The fight against pollution problems has sparked a myriad of Environmental Protection Tax (EPT) policies by governments across the globe. However, it remains unclear whether and how EPT affects the level of corporate risk-taking. To narrow the gap, this research selects the EPT policy implemented in 2018 as a quasi-natural experiment to test the effect of EPT on the level of corporate risk-taking by using the sample of Chinese listed firms from 2014 to 2022. The result finds that EPT could dampen the level of corporate risk-taking. Mechanism analysis shows that, the increased market attention, elevated financing costs, and raised investment in end-of-pipe pollution control are the mechanisms by which EPT reduces the level of corporate risk-taking. The “market pressure hypothesis” and “resource dependence hypothesis” of corporate risk-taking can help us better understand these three paths. Moreover, the heterogeneity analysis reveals that the disincentive effect is more pronounced in small enterprises, and those with high financing constraints and low institutional investor ownership. Meanwhile, the disincentive effect is also more pronounced for enterprises located in regions with underdeveloped digital financial inclusion and strong law enforcement. Overall, our findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of EPT on corporate risk-taking at the micro level and provide valuable insights for targeted policy enhancements.},

Empirical evidence suggests that banks' digital transformation has a negative impact on their profitability to some extent, but digital inclusive finance has enabled the bank to change its digital transformation behavior and enhance its operational performance. Therefore, banks must continue to strengthen their digital transformation by expanding online customer services, increasing the use of e-accounts and mobile applications, providing digital offline services, strengthening digital risk management and privacy and security controls, reducing customer psychological risk, and promoting financial inclusion. Financial inclusion should simultaneously achieve reduced financial exclusion of customers and increased financial literacy of customers.

	doi = {10.1002/mde.3831},
	abstract = {Digital transformation has become a general trend for enterprises, and it is necessary to investigate the impact of government support on enterprises' digital transformation from the perspective of policy instruments. But so far, there is less empirical evidence on their relationship. Based on Chinese firm-level data, we investigate the effects of government subsidies and tax incentives on enterprises' digital transformation. The results show that two forms of government support both positively promote enterprises' digital transformation. Moreover, we analyze which factors mediate the observed effects. We demonstrate that easing financial constraints, increasing Research and Development (R\&D) investment, and improving risk-taking ability are underlying mechanisms. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that enterprises that are non-state-owned, with higher technology level and higher absorptive capacity, have higher digital transformation. The higher the level of digital finance development and network infrastructure construction in a region, the greater the positive effect of government support on enterprises' digital transformation. The results provide clearer guidance for governments to provide government support so as to stimulate enterprises' digital transformation.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.eneco.2024.107575},
	abstract = {The negative externalities of air pollution constrain the transformation of the real economy. Identifying the intrinsic association between air pollution and enterprise digital transformation (EDT) under the wave of the digital economy can help realize the synergistic promotion of green development and the digitalization process. The paper examines the impact of air pollution on EDT by matching the data of listed enterprises in Shanghai and Shenzhen, China, from 2010 to 2019 with city -level air pollution data. This paper uncovers the following findings: First, air pollution significantly hinders EDT. This finding remains robust after accounting for endogeneity, strategic disclosure in enterprise annual reports, and sample self-selection. Second, the effect of air pollution on EDT is asymmetric at the enterprise, industry, and regional levels. Specifically, air pollution exerts a more pronounced dampening effect on EDT in state-owned enterprises, heavily polluting industries, and lowmarketization regions. Third, air pollution dampens EDT by increasing economic policy uncertainty external to the enterprise, reducing its internal talent reserve, and crowding out its digital investments. Fourth, augmenting the size of government subsidies, promoting digital infrastructure construction, and strengthening digital financial development are effective ways to mitigate air pollution ` s impediments to EDT. Fifth, in the face of severe air pollution, aggressive digital transformation strategies adopted by enterprises can alleviate financing constraints and enhance enterprise value. This paper effectively identifies the cost of pollution in the digital era from an EDT perspective, providing important policy insights for advancing EDT under air pollution.},

	volume = {60},
	doi = {10.1016/j.techsoc.2019.101219},
	abstract = {Amazon became the world R\&D leader in 2017 by rapidly increasing R\&D investment. Its R\&D investment in 2017 was double that of 2015, 5 times that of 2012, and 10 times that of 2011. This rapid increase continued in 2018, and Amazon accomplished a skyrocketing increase in its market capitalization, closing to being the world's biggest company. Such a rapid increase in R\&D and subsequent market value has raised questions about how to conduct R\&D and secure a large amount of funds needed for high-risk investments. Amazon has provided hypothetical answers to both of these questions. Amazon has been conducting innovative R\&D to transform routine or periodic alterations into significant improvements during the R\&D process and claiming huge expenses for such transformation activities as expenses for R\&D. The company's ample free cash flow generated by sophisticated cash conversion cycle (CCC) management endorsed a large amount of investment for such a high-risk strategy. Increased R\&D induced business advancement and lean cost structure construction leading to a further increase in cash flow has stimulated interactions between vendors, customers, and Amazon via the Amazon marketplace. Activated interaction-accelerated CCC advancement, a subsequent free cash flow increase, and user-driven innovation have thus simultaneously accelerated R\&D transformation. All of these components - R\&D transformation and technopreneurial strategy consisting of technology management, as well as marketplace development and CCC-driven cash flow generation consisting of financing management - function together as a consolidated sophisticated machine. Thus, Amazon has succeeded in fusing technology management and financing management by orchestrating all techno-financing systems. In light of increasing concerns regarding R\&D expansion without the dilemma of a productivity decline that most digital economies are now confronting, this paper demonstrates the above hypothetical answers. Following the authors' preceding analysis of Amazon's unique technology management toward a new concept of R\&D in the digital economy, an intensive empirical analysis focusing on the development trajectory of Amazon's techno-financing system over the last two decades was conducted. An insightful suggestion as to neo-open innovation that fuses technology management and financing management is thus provided.},

	abstract = {A promising approach forfacilitating China's shift towards renewable energy sources entails combining digital finance and green financing. The present research investigates the supply chains and reverse logistics of significant financial indices, including the S\&P Green Bond Index, the MSCI Global Markets Index, and the S\&P Global Renewable Energy Index. The analysis encompasses the period from the creation of these indices on September 28, 2008, through January 12, 2022. To minimize risk, portfolios have increasingly adopted diverse indices, such as the S\&P Global Clean Energy Index and the S\&P Green Bond Index. This study investigates the intricate relationship between green financing and digital finance, shedding light on their combined impact on the uptake of renewable energy in China. This study examines the role of digital financial technologies, including blockchain, mobile payment systems, and big data analytics, in enhancing the accessibility of green financing choices for renewable energy projects. A comprehensive analysis of existing literature and empirical research is conducted to achieve this objective. The results emphasize the significant progress in improving financial inclusion, risk management, and transparency by integrating green financing and digital finance. As mentioned earlier, the enhancements have significantly enhanced the level of trust and assurance among investors operating within the renewable energy industry. Moreover, the report highlights the crucial need for continuous governmental backing and financial investments in digital financial infrastructure to drive China towards a more environmentally friendly and sustainable energy framework.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jik.2022.100292},
	abstract = {FinTech is an emerging financial innovation model that promotes a “technological anti-corruption”effect. Credit corruption is a worldwide problem; however, previous studies have not focused on the anti -corrup-tion effect of FinTech. This study first uses micro data from FinTech companies to construct city-level FinTech measurement indicators in China. An objective measurement of credit corruption is then formed by separat-ing the expenditures for credit corruption from total business entertainment expenses. This study empirically explores the impact of FinTech on credit corruption using a sample of Chinese listed companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges from 2011 to 2019. The results show that FinTech can significantly curb credit corruption, and that the expenditures for credit corruption of local companies are lower with bet-ter regional FinTech. These findings are valid after addressing endogeneity issues and conducting a series of robustness tests. The results of the heterogeneity test show that FinTech offers greater advantages for risk identification, information mining, and inclusive development than traditional finance. The curbing effect on credit corruption is stronger in companies with better intrinsic quality, more transparent information disclo-sure, located in less financially developed and more corrupt regions. Economic consequence analysis sug-gests that FinTech can correct resource misallocation caused by credit corruption and promote corporate investment efficiency. These findings are valuable for policy practices for technological anti-corruption in the financial sector. \& COPY; 2022 The Author(s).

	volume = {89},
	doi = {10.1016/j.resourpol.2023.104528},
	abstract = {Mineral resources play a vital role in the development of renewable energy investment. Therefore, studying the factors that can influence the mineral resources trade is crucial in increasing the pace of global efforts toward energy transition. The conventional environment of natural resource trading is going through substantial changes in an age characterized by quick technology breakthroughs and increased dependence on digital finance systems. In addition, countries' policies and plans are now heavily influenced by the quest for energy security. However, whether digital inclusion and energy security risks have any role in boosting mineral resources trade is an empirical question overlooked by past studies. The current analysis fills the gap by investigating the influence of digital inclusion and energy security risks on mineral resources trade in world-leading mineral trading countries by utilizing 2SLS and GMM methods for the period from 2007 to 2022. The findings indicate that mineral trade is favorably influenced by digital finance and related variables such as ATMs, bank branches, debit cards, and electronic payments. While ICT has beneficial effects on the expansion of trade in mineral resources. Likewise, energy security risks proliferate the trade in mineral resources. Additionally, GDP and foreign direct investment positively contribute to the trade in mineral resources. In contrast, the consumer price index hurts mineral resources trade. Thus, governments can establish a more robust, fair, and ecologically sustainable global natural resources trading landscape by coordinating policies to take advantage of the favorable synergies between digital finance and energy security issues.},

	title = {A consumer-welfare approach to network neutrality regulation of the internet},
	volume = {2},
	doi = {10.1093/joclec/nhl016},
	abstract = {“Network neutrality” is the shorthand for a proposed regime of economic regulation for the Internet. Because of the trend to deliver traditional telecommunications services, as well as new forms of content and applications, by Internet protocol (IP), a regime of network neutrality regulation would displace or subordinate a substantial portion of existing telecommunications regulation. If the United States adopts network neutrality regulation, other industrialized nations probably will soon follow. As a result of their investment to create next-generation broadband networks, network operators have the ability to innovate inside the network by offering both senders and receivers of information greater bandwidth and prioritization of delivery. Network neutrality regulation would, among other things, prevent providers of broadband Internet access service (such as digital subscriber line (DSL) or cable modem service) from offering a guaranteed, expedited delivery speed in return for the payment of a fee. The practical effect of banning such differential pricing (called “access tiering” by its critics) would be to prevent the pricing of access to content or applications providers according to priority of delivery. To the extent that an advertiser of a good or service would be willing to contract with a network operator for advertising space on the network operator's affiliated content, another practical effect of network neutrality regulation would be to erect a barrier to vertical integration of network operators into advertising-based business models that could supplement or replace revenues earned from their existing usage-based business models. Moreover, by making end-users pay for the full cost of broadband access, network neutrality regulation would deny broadband access to the large number of consumers who would not be able to afford, or who would not have a willingness to pay for, what would otherwise be less expensive access. For example, Google is planning to offer broadband access to end-users for free in San Francisco by charging other content providers for advertising. This product offering is evidently predicated on the belief that many end-users demand discounted or free broadband access that is paid for by parties other than themselves. Proponents of network neutrality regulation argue that such restrictions on the pricing policies of network operators are necessary to preserve innovation on the edges of the network, as opposed to innovation within the network. However, recognizing that network congestion and real-time applications demand some differential pricing according to bandwidth or priority, proponents of network neutrality regulation would allow broadband Internet access providers to charge higher prices to end-users (but not content or applications providers) who consume more bandwidth or who seek priority delivery of certain traffic. Thus, the debate over network neutrality is essentially a debate over how best to finance the construction and maintenance of a broadband network in a two-sided market in which senders and receivers have additive demand for the delivery of a given piece of information-and hence additive willingness to pay. Well-established tools of Ramsey pricing from regulatory economics can shed light on whether network congestion and recovery of sunk investment in infrastructure are best addressed by charging providers of content and applications, broadband users, or both for expedited delivery. Apart from this pricing problem, an analytically simpler component of proposed network neutrality regulaion would prohibit a network operator from denying its users access to certain websites and Internet applications, such as voice over Internet protocol (VoIP). Although some instances of blocking of VoIP have been reported, such conduct is not a serious risk to competition. To address this concern, I analyze whether market forces (that is, competition among access providers) and existing regulatory structures are sufficient to protect broadband users. I conclude that economic welfare would be maximized by allowing access providers to differentiate services vis-a-vis providers of content and applications in value-enhancing ways and by relying on existing legal regimes to protect consumers against the exercise of market power, should it exist.},

This paper attempts to characterize investors' perceptions around the concept of digital innovation governance. We present insights derived from qualitative research using constructivist grounded theory, based on a series of interviews to 23 venture capital investment managers. Analysis of the data collected suggests several categories of important factors regarding how venture capital managers engage in Digital Innovation Governance (DIG): legitimacy of involvement, opportunity of conducting and capability to lead DIG initiatives in the invested startups. We offer a structured inventory of venture capital manager insights and perceptions on innovation governance. According to our research, venture capital managers, and investors in general, find themselves capable of and see opportunities and relevance in effectively fostering a digital innovation governance that takes into account the potential risks of Artificial Intelligence and identifies business and societal opportunities.},

	abstract = {The chief information officer (CIO) is responsible for bridging the gap between two critical domains-technology and business, making the CIO's job uniquely different from other executives. As digital technologies become increasingly important to firms' competitive success, boards of directors and senior executives seek to align the CIO role with overall firm's objectives. Agency theory suggests that one way to create the alignment between an executive's efforts and firm performance is to implement appropriate equity compensation incentives (i.e., those resulting from stock and stock options) tying the executive's wealth to firm value. To date, research does not address what factors a firm should consider when designing CIO incentives and how these incentives influence firm performance. To address this major gap, we examine both the antecedents and performance consequences of CIO equity incentives. We assess organizational, environmental, and individual factors that influence CIO equity incentives and find that environmental and organizational factors are more important than individual CIO characteristics in the determination of CIO equity incentives. We also find that firms that create higher CIO equity incentives realize greater subsequent accounting and market performance. Our research contributes to the IT personnel literature by showing how firms can use compensation policies to leverage the CIO role to enhance overall business performance.},

The potential of the blockchain technology is phenomenal with recent estimates suggesting it will be worth more than \$20 trillion in just two years, which is more than the entire American economy.

Apparently the growing acceptability of digital fiat money as a result of technology development on one hand, and the failure of the paper money to mitigate inflation and other economic disequilibria since the disappearance of the gold standard on the other, various forms of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoins (referred to as the king) appear to roar toward wider recognition. However, an emerging phenomenon associated with cryptocurrency revolution is an observed significant fluctuation (the tide) in its value and thus a subject of discussion within Islamic finance community and beyond. In the midst of this also is the current agitation founded on some of the Islamic law (Shari'a) view on the necessity of asset-backed money, to be extended to the current cryptocurrency innovation for its transformation into a Shari.a compliant precious metal backed currency. The big question now which this chapter sought to provide the answer is, what are the implications of these developments to a more established and widening global phenomenon of Islamic finance and its development in Muslim world vis-a-vis aspirations for sustained economic development. The work finds that cryptocurrencies would generate three advantages over all forms of money including gold through: establishing a unified financial system through its standard decentralization, being rarer than gold and its significant mitigation of inflation. It is also noted that the prevalent foreign exchange risk resulting from the underlying activities (rather than the currency itself) is free from speculation (Gharar). It is, therefore, recommended that stakeholders in the Islamic Finance world should not be passive but be proactive in commencing processes to develop technical notes, standards, and operational guidelines to partake in the inevitable migration to cryptocurrencies.},

Using a panel of nation-wide data from the China Household Finance Survey, we find digital financial inclusion significantly reduces the probability of households taking extreme portfolio risks by promoting diversification. It also plays a greater role among households with low levels of wealth and financial literacy, located in areas where traditional finance has been slow to develop. These findings suggest that Internet-based financial products are needed that are better suited to households with low levels of wealth and financial literacy.},

Digital transformation is highly uncertain, and it is crucial to examine the impact of corporate digital transformation on the integration of digital and real economies. Using all non-financial Chinese A-share listed companies from 2012 to 2021 as the research sample, we investigate the impact of digital transformation on corporate financial asset allocation. The study finds that there is a significant inverted U-shaped relationship between digital transformation and defensive financial asset allocation and a significant positive relationship with profit-seeking financial asset allocation. The mechanism analysis shows that digital transformation impacts the allocation of defensive financial assets through the operational risk of enterprises and promotes the allocation of profit-seeking financial assets through the path of financing arbitrage. Furthermore, the impact of digital transformation on the enterprises' financial asset allocation varies somewhat across property rights, regions, and industries. This finding has some implications for promoting digital transformation and guiding the real economy to transfer from fictitious to substantial.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jestch.2021.01.007},
	abstract = {The stock market currently remains one of the most difficult systems to model in finance. Hence, it is a challenge to solve stock portfolio allocation wherein an optimal investment strategy must be found for a curated collection of stocks that effectively maximizes return while minimizing the risk involved. Deep reinforcement learning approaches have shown promising results when used to automate portfolio allocation, by training an intelligent agent on historical stock prices. However, modern investors are actively engaging with digital platforms such as social media and online news websites to understand and better analyze portfolios. The overall attitude thus formed by investors toward a particular stock or financial market is known as market sentiment. Existing approaches do not incorporate market sentiment which has been empirically shown to influence investor decisions. In our paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach to effectively train an intelligent automated trader, that not only uses the historical stock price data but also perceives market sentiment for a stock portfolio consisting of the Dow Jones companies. We demonstrate that our approach is more robust in comparison to existing baselines across standardized metrics such as the Sharpe ratio and annualized investment return. (C) 2021 Karabuk University.

The findings reveal that digital finance exerts significant and positive influence on green innovation. Digital finance institutions alleviate information asymmetry in the green innovation market through digital technologies such as big data analysis of firm behavior to directly promote firms' innovation behavior. The internal mechanism analysis reveals that digital finance indirectly promotes green innovation by improving the quality of firms' environmental information disclosure and reducing financial constraints. The heterogeneity analysis indicates that the promotional effect of digital finance on green innovation is more prominent in larger and state-owned enterprises.},

	abstract = {Amid the rapid evolution of economic activities, climate risk has become a significant challenge for China, profoundly influencing corporate investment decisions. This study explores the effects and mechanisms of climate risk on corporate green innovation efficiency within the Chinese context. The findings reveal that climate risk significantly enhances corporate green innovation efficiency through two stages: green technology R\&D and the conversion of green outcomes, facilitated by external supervision and digital transformation mechanisms. Specifically, climate risk increases public awareness and the effectiveness of supervision over corporate environmental performance, while also bolstering the intrinsic motivation for corporate digital transformation, collectively enhancing green innovation efficiency. Furthermore, government green subsidies, market competition intensity, and corporate innovation continuity positively moderate the impact of climate risk on green innovation efficiency. These effects are particularly pronounced in high-tech firms, state-owned enterprises, firms with fewer financing constraints, and those with robust environmental management systems. Ultimately, the positive effect of climate risk on corporate green innovation efficiency further enhances corporate green total factor productivity. This research provides valuable insights for companies striving to harmonize economic benefits with environmental performance.},

	abstract = {Vietnam is actively pursuing sustainable economic development while transitioning to a greener economy, facing challenges in balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability. The evaluation of current sustainable development efforts and the identification of effective green financial tools are critical for Vietnam's progress. This study introduces the Sustainable Economic Development (SED) Index, a comprehensive measure of sustainable economic development quality across Vietnam's 63 provinces from 2015 to 2022. Using a range of analytical techniques, we explore the relationships between green credit, environmental pollution, and sustainable economic development during this period. Our findings indicate rapid growth in sustainable economic development until 2019, followed by a deceleration due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war. Green credit emerges as a pivotal factor in supporting sustainable economic growth, managing climate risks, and mitigating environmental pollution, particularly during times of uncertainty. Additionally, we observe spatial spillover effects, where the benefits of green credit and the challenges of environmental pollution transcend provincial boundaries. The study recommends promoting green credit policies, fostering regional cooperation, and enhancing local competitiveness, digital transformation, and social equality to advance Vietnam's journey toward sustainable economic development.},

	abstract = {This paper uses the panel data of Chinese listed enterprises from 2010 to 2019 to explore the relationship be-tween digital finance (DF) and enterprise investment efficiency. The result of two-way fixed effects regression shows that the DF significantly improves enterprise investment efficiency. And the result is robust to different indicators of digital finance and possible endogenous biases. Further mechanism analyses find that the impact of DF on total debt was insignificant whereas it significantly changes financial composition which in turn affects the investment efficiency of enterprises. Specifically, the mediating effect of financial structure changes in both magnitude and direction with respect to the type of loans, and investment efficiency of under-and over-invested enterprises responses asymmetrically to the DF-induced financial structure adjustments. Overall, financial diversity decreases significantly with the inclusion of DF, which in turn improves enterprise investment efficiency. The results of this paper indicate that, in order to improve investment efficiency, the composition adjustment effect of DF should be further exerted with financing inclined to credit loans and guaranteed loans and guarding against excessive looseness of mortgage loans.},

Liquidity constraints, payment convenience, investment efficiency and household risk-hedging ability are proven to be important channels in the mechanism. Our findings are robust to the dynamic GMM estimation and instrumental variable analysis.

	abstract = {Advancements in material science and production technologies of solar photovoltaics (PV) system components, have obvious impacts in terms of Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) reductions over time. Beside such technologies in physical sciences, digitalization technologies have increasingly positive impacts on the cost efficient operation and investment planning of the solar energy investments and keep the current cost decline trajectory for the PV industry. One option to achieve this may be through digital financial innovations such as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) based crowdfunding for project finance. This option would enable multiple small investors to offer loans with lower interest rates and longer debt tenors than traditional financiers, such as banks, while increasing the acceptable debt fraction for a project due to the higher risk tolerance of individual investors coupled with the risk reduction that this innovation could allow. This new aspect of the digital partial ownership of the energy projects is demonstrated using a functional DLT-based crowdfunding mechanism. Furthermore, impacts of the proposed approach is demonstrated by calculating the LCOE values for the European countries by comparing with the traditional investment options. According to the findings of this study digitalization technologies especially DLT has positive impact in terms of reducing the financial costs and also LCOE values of solar energy projects. Additionally, these estimated cost values are used for analyzing the grid parity of PV systems in each assessed country.

	abstract = {Previous literature indicates that digitalization offers enterprises competitive advantages. However, However, its potential impact on risk management remains uncertain. Thus, this study explores the causality between digital transformation and systematic risk of Chinese public companies during 2007-2020. We developed a digital-related keywords dictionary using textual analysis to identify investments in digital assets which serve as a measure of corporate digitalization. Our findings suggest a negative correlation between digital transformation and enterprise systematic risk. This relationship is further supported by robustness tests, adjustments for endogeneity, and random forest predictions. The risk-reducing effect of digitalization is more pronounced in non-state-owned, small, high-asset-density, and low-investor-attention enterprises. Additionally, we explore potential mechanisms: the financial leverage channel, operating leverage channel, and investor loyalty channel. Empirical observations indicate that enterprise digitalization: (1) lowers financing costs, curbing an inclination towards excessive debt; (2) enhances operational cost management and stimulates sales growth; and (3) boosts long-term investor holdings, decreases stock price synchronization, and mitigates crash risks. This study offers new insights into assessing the sustainability of digitalization and mitigating systematic risks of enterprises.},

	abstract = {With the rapid advancement of digital finance in China, accessing wealth management services through digital platforms has become considerably convenient. However, the potential impact of digital platform investments on residents' consumption remains a relatively unexplored question. This study addresses this gap by leveraging a unique dataset obtained from one of China's largest fintech companies, encompassing individual-level data on consumption and investment. Our findings indicate that engaging in digital platform investments can indeed stimulate residents' consumption. Importantly, participation in digital platform investment has an inclusive effect, with a more pronounced marginal impact on consumption among low-income residents and in-dividuals residing in finance-underdeveloped cities. Additionally, the positive influence of digital platform investment on consumption primarily stems from two channels, the wealth effect resulting from investment returns and from investment diversification in a diverse range of wealth management products. The wealth effect is more pronounced among low-risk investments when risk diversification is limited, while more pronounced among high-risk investments when the portfolio is diversified.},

	abstract = {This article takes up recent calls to further problematize race in international political economy by focusing on money at the frontier of global finance. We draw upon the Black radical tradition's theoretical formulations of racial capitalism, which we bring into dialogue with conceptualizations of money and finance as developed within the critique of political economy. Money is the most supreme and abstract incarnation of wealth and class power, yet it is also suffused with racial and colonial logics of differentiation. To explore this tension, we offer a relational-comparison of two sites of frontier finance, namely cross-border investment and digital financial inclusion in developing countries. We trace the mechanisms through which race affects the operations of money and finance across these two sites. We argue that racialized difference is mobilized and reproduced at three key moments in the construction of investibility at the financial frontier: (1) the re/making of a development `problem'; (2) the construction of racialized ideal-typical financial subjects; and (3) processes of risk valuation and the legitimation of surveillance, discipline, and extraction. This allows us to characterize the color of money at the financial frontier as a particularly potent and violent combination of the abstractive powers of race and money.},

This article examines Chinese A-shares listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2010 to 2021 as a research sample, utilizing a multi-period double difference model to investigate the impact of cross-border e-commerce reform on enterprise supply chain risk. The findings suggest that cross-border e-commerce reform significantly mitigates supply chain risks for enterprises. Further heterogeneity testing revealed that the establishment of cross-border e-commerce pilot zones primarily reduces supply chain risks for non-state-owned enterprises located in coastal areas and those with digital infrastructure. The mechanism test demonstrates that cross-border e-commerce reform lowers the supply chain risk level of enterprises by enhancing their degree of digital transformation and easing their financing constraints. Additionally, the economic consequence test shows that cross-border e-commerce reform improves investment efficiency and reduces the risk of stock price collapse by alleviating supply chain risks. The research conclusions drawn offer important insights on how to leverage cross-border e-commerce development to mitigate supply chain risks.},

Mechanism analysis reveals GFPZ increased financial constraints of heavily polluting companies, compelling them to invest in green projects to improve their financing opportunities. Heterogeneity analysis highlights a greater impact on companies with substantial institutional investor shareholdings, high analyst coverage, extensive digital transformation, and rigorous regional environmental regulation. Further analysis shows that GFPZ notably boosts preventive green investment but not remedial green investment. Additionally, GFPZ amplifies CGI's positive effects on green innovation and carbon emission reductions.

The resolution of green financial risk will help protect the interests of all stakeholders and promote the development of green finance. This study suggests that intelligence service provides new ideas and ways for green financial risk management. Applying intelligence service to green financial risk management will contribute to the sustainable development of green finance and enrich the theoretical system of intelligence science. This study first builds an intelligence service system of green financial risk management from five aspects: intelligence demand, intelligence collection, intelligence processing, intelligence application, and intelligence tracking. A questionnaire is designed based on this system. The first batch of green finance pilot cities in China (Ganjiang, Gui'an, Guangzhou, Huzhou, Quzhou, Changji, Hami, and Karamay) are investigated. This study uses a regression model to analyze the data and analyzes the intelligence service status of green financial risk management in pilot cities. The research divides those green finance pilot cities into eastern, central, and western regions. It shows obvious differences in the intelligence service elements in the eastern, central, and western regions of green financial risk management. The eastern region pays more attention to the three elements of intelligence demand, intelligence application, and intelligence tracking when carrying out green financial risk management. In the process of green financial risk management in the western region, there are obvious deficiencies in the two elements of intelligence collection and intelligence processing, which may be due to the lack of advanced digital equipment and effective digital resource. The central region lies between the eastern and western regions on intelligence service of green financial risk management. Based on the above results, this study proposes that establishing an intelligence center, sharing intelligence resources, improving digital technology, and updating intelligence cases can enhance the effectiveness of intelligence service in the risk management of green finance.},

This paper aims to systematically examine the impact of digital transformation on debt default risk, using A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2022 as the research sample. The findings indicate that digital transformation significantly reduces the risk of debt default, and this conclusion is supported by a series of robustness tests. Heterogeneity analysis based on firm-specific characteristics reveals that companies with higher returns on assets, higher R\&D investment, larger scale, higher debt-to-asset ratio, greater regional social trust, and higher information transparency experience a more pronounced risk mitigation effect from digital transformation. Mechanism tests demonstrate that digital transformation primarily lowers debt default risk through two channels: alleviating financing constraints and improving total factor productivity. Digital transformation more effectively reduces corporate debt default risk through foundational technologies compared to practical applications. These conclusions contribute to a deeper understanding of how digital transformation drives high-quality development in enterprises and provide a comprehensive assessment of the implementation effects of digital transformation.},

As the industrial landscape has become complex and dynamic due to the rapid pace of technological changes and digital transformation, identifying industrial trends can be critical for strategic planning and investment policy at the firm and regional level. For this purpose, the paper examines industry and technology profiles of top startups across four industries (i.e. education, finance, healthcare, manufacturing) using CrunchBase metadata for the period 2016-2018 and studies in which subsector early-stage firms bring digital technologies on a global level. In particular, we apply word co-occurrence analysis to reveal which subindustry and digital technology keywords/keyphrases appear together in startup company classification. We also use network analysis to visualize industry structure and to identify digitalization trends across sectors. The results obtained from the analysis show that gamification and personalization are emerging trends in the education sector. In the finance industry, digital technologies penetrate in a wide set of services such as financial transactions, payments, insurance, venture capital, stock exchange, asset and risk management. Moreover, the data analyses indicate that health diagnostics and elderly care areas are at the forefront of the healthcare industry digitalization. In the manufacturing sector, startup companies focus on automating industrial processes and creating smart interconnected manufacturing.

	abstract = {Using data on a sample of 803 investment rounds in fintech companies (FTCs) held between 2008 and 2018 at the global level, where each company received investment from at least one financial institution, we investigate how banks react to digital transformation through the direct investment channel. Each round is treated as an independent event; hence, we examine 1,078 bank-FTC observations. Employing OLS regressions, we explore the determinants of deal size, both in absolute (i.e., monetary flows) and relative terms (i.e., the proportion of the total funding that the target has cumulatively received). Conversely, with probit analysis, we investigate the determinants of banks' choices to invest in “fin-native” vs. “tech-native” FTCs and those of their decisions to use equity (i.e., capital injections) vs. debt (i.e., credit lines). We find that investments are enhanced by an FTC's specialisation in financial rather than technological services, by the presence of other investors, and - to some extent - when the target is in a later stage of development and the bank is large. Additionally, the nature of a target depends largely (but not exclusively) on the corresponding bank's risk-return profile, as fin-native companies and debt financing are perceived as safer than tech-native companies and equity financing, respectively. Finally, we find that a limited but non-negligible role is played by the regulatory framework, which mainly affects the choice of financing tool by prompting banks to choose equity - i.e., a bolder risk-return profile - when they face harsher competition from unlicensed lenders.},

Using the fraud triangle framework, this study examines pressure, opportunity, and rationalization from individual and organizational perspectives. The research provides a comprehensive understanding of the contributing factors to NFT marketplace fraud by analyzing the reasons behind fraudulent actions. A conceptual framework is developed that includes ten propositions to aid in understanding the complexity of this issue. This study’s outcomes will assist policymakers in crafting efficient approaches to mitigate fraud within the NFT marketplace.},

	abstract = {AbstractNon Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that represent objects like art, collectible, and in-game items. They are traded online, often with cryptocurrency, and are generally encoded within smart contracts on a blockchain. Public attention towards NFTs has exploded in 2021, when their market has experienced record sales, but little is known about the overall structure and evolution of its market. Here, we analyse data concerning 6.1 million trades of 4.7 million NFTs between June 23, 2017 and April 27, 2021, obtained primarily from Ethereum and WAX blockchains. First, we characterize statistical properties of the market. Second, we build the network of interactions, show that traders typically specialize on NFTs associated with similar objects and form tight clusters with other traders that exchange the same kind of objects. Third, we cluster objects associated to NFTs according to their visual features and show that collections contain visually homogeneous objects. Finally, we investigate the predictability of NFT sales using simple machine learning algorithms and find that sale history and, secondarily, visual features are good predictors for price. We anticipate that these findings will stimulate further research on NFT production, adoption, and trading in different contexts.},

These improvements are more pro­ nounced in regions with underdeveloped traditional finance or robust investor protection. This study not only contributes to understanding the nexus between digital inclusive finance and investor behavior but also suggests policy implications.

            We develop a dynamic asset pricing model of cryptocurrencies/tokens that allow users to conduct peer-to-peer transactions on digital platforms. The equilibrium price of tokens is determined by aggregating heterogeneous users’ transactional demand, rather than discounting cash flows as is done in standard valuations models. Endogenous platform adoption builds on user network externality and exhibits an \$S\$-curve: it starts slow, becomes volatile, and eventually tapers off. The introduction of tokens lowers users’ transaction costs on the platform by allowing users to capitalize on platform growth. The resultant intertemporal feedback between user adoption and token price accelerates adoption and dampens user-base volatility.},

First, it answers the question of why “FinTech” is happening right now. Many of the technologies that support FinTech innovations are not new, but financial institutions and entrepreneurs are only now applying them to financial products and services. Analysis of the supply and demand factors that drive “traditional” financial innovation reveals a confluence of factors driving a large quantity of innovation. Second, this paper answers the question of why FinTech is getting so much more attention than traditional innovation normally does. The answer to this question has to do with the ‘depth’ of innovation, a concept introduced in this paper. The deeper an innovation, the greater the ability of that innovation to transform financial services. The paper shows that many FinTech innovations are deep innovations and hence have a greater potential to change financial services. A greater potential to transform can also lead to a greater chance of affecting financial stability.},

	abstract = {One of the most inﬂuential ideas in the past 30 years of the Journal of Portfolio Management is the Eﬃcient Markets Hypothesis, the idea that market prices incorporate all information rationally and instantaneously. However, the emerging discipline of behavioral economics and ﬁnance has challenged this hypothesis, arguing that markets are not rational, but are driven by fear and greed instead. Recent research in the cognitive neurosciences suggests that these two perspectives are opposite sides of the same coin. In this article I propose a new framework that reconciles market eﬃciency with behavioral alternatives by applying the principles of evolution—competition, adaptation, and natural selection—to ﬁnancial interactions. By extending Herbert Simon’s notion of “satisﬁcing” with evolutionary dynamics, I argue that much of what behavioralists cite as counterexamples to economic rationality—loss aversion, overconﬁdence, overreaction, mental accounting, and other behavioral biases—are, in fact, consistent with an evolutionary model of individuals adapting to a changing environment via simple heuristics. Despite the qualitative nature of this new paradigm, the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis oﬀers a number of surprisingly concrete implications for the practice of portfolio management.},

Time-invariant lender attributes explain little of this rate dispersion, and considerable dispersion remains even within loan oﬃcer. Comparing the rates borrowers obtain to the real-time distribution of rates that lenders could oﬀer for the same loan and borrower type, we ﬁnd that borrowers who are likely to be the least ﬁnancially savvy tend to substantially overpay relative to the rates available in the market. In the time series, the average overpayment decreases when overall market interest rates rise, suggesting that a rising level of borrowing costs encourages more search and negotiation. Furthermore, new survey data provide direct evidence that ﬁnancial knowledge and shopping both aﬀect the mortgage rates borrowers get, and that shopping activity increases with the level of market rates.},

We estimate the presence and importance of hidden information and hidden action problems in a consumer credit market using a new field experiment methodology. We randomized 58,000 direct mail offers to former clients of a major South African lender along three dimensions: (i) an initial “offer interest rate” featured on a direct mail solicitation; (ii) a “contract interest rate” that was revealed only after a borrower agreed to the initial offer rate; and (ii) a dynamic repayment incentive that was also a surprise and extended preferential pricing on future loans to borrowers who remained in good standing. These three randomizations, combined with complete knowledge of the lender's information set, permit identification of specific types of private information problems. Our setup distinguishes hidden information effects from selection on the offer rate (via unobservable risk and anticipated effort), from hidden action effects (via moral hazard in effort) induced by actual contract terms. We find strong evidence of moral hazard and weaker evidence of hidden information problems. A rough estimate suggests that perhaps 13\% to 21\% of default is due to moral hazard. Asymmetric information thus may help explain the prevalence of credit constraints even in a market that specializes in financing high-risk borrowers.},

Credit score cutoff rules thus cannot be used to learn about the moral hazard effect of securitization on underwriting.

	volume = {National Bureau of Economic Research},
	url = {https://www.nber.org/papers/w24582},
	abstract = {We show that maturity transformation does not expose banks to significant interest rate risk{\textbar}it hedges it. This is due to banks' deposit franchise. The deposit franchise gives banks substantial market power over deposits, allowing them to pay deposit rates that are low and insensitive to market interest rates. Maintaining this power requires banks to incur large, interest-insensitive operating costs, so that the total costs of deposits are similar to fixed-rate, long-term debt. Hedging these costs therefore requires banks to lend long term{\textbar}i.e., to do maturity transformation. As predicted by this theory, we document that banks' net interest margins have been highly stable and insensitive to interest rates, and banks' net worth is largely insulated from monetary policy shocks. We further show that banks match the interest-rate sensitivities of their expenses and income one-for-one, so that banks with less interest-sensitive deposits (more market power) hold assets with substantially longer duration. Our results show that deposits are special because they are short-term and yet have interest-insensitive costs, which explains why banks are able to supply long-term credit.},

Consequently, banks can insure firms against systematic declines in liquidity at lower cost than other institutions. We provide evidence that when liquidity dries up and commercial paper spreads widen, banks experience funding inf lows. These f lows allow banks to meet loan demand from borrowers drawing funds from commercial paper backup lines without running down their holdings of liquid assets. We also provide evidence that implicit government support for banks during crises explains these funding f lows.},

Within the financial milieu, there is an ongoing pursuit for more precise, optimized, secure, and agile solutions capable of managing multifarious financial undertakings. Emerging technologies present remarkable modalities for achieving these objectives. This scholarly exposition expounds upon the creation of emerging technologies within the financial world, while concurrently deliberating upon the prospective applications of these technologies within financial systems. Given the nascent stage of development that characterizes these emerging technologies, the advancement of financial performance emerges as a substantial challenge owing to both technological and operational advantages.

This paper explores this question using the Federal Reserve’s framework for analyzing vulnerabilities in the traditional financial system. The digital asset ecosystem has recently proven itself to be highly fragile. However, adverse digital asset market shocks have had limited spillovers to the traditional financial system. Currently, the digital asset ecosystem does not provide significant financial services outside the ecosystem, and it exhibits limited interconnections with the traditional financial system. The paper describes emerging vulnerabilities that could present risks to financial stability in the future if the digital asset ecosystem becomes more systemic, including run risks among large stablecoins, valuation pressures in crypto-assets, fragilities of DeFi platforms, growing interconnectedness, and a general lack of regulation.},

	abstract = {Digital assets (DAs) are a unique asset class that presents investors with opportunities and risks that are contingent upon their particular characteristics such as volatility, type, and profile, among other factors. Among DAs, cryptocurrencies (CCs) have emerged as the most liquid asset class, holding this distinction for almost a decade. However, while CCs offer a high level of liquidity, investors must be aware of the potential risks and rewards associated with investing in this asset class, and should conduct a thorough evaluation before making any investment decisions. Our study examines the risk profile of CCs through portfolio analysis, utilizing Spectral Risk Measures (SRMs) as the commonly applied method. In this study, we investigate the application of SRMs in assessing the risk structure of CC portfolios, and their alignment with investors’ risk preferences. We employ SRMs to evaluate the CC index CRIX and portfolios constructed from the most liquid 10 CCs from the Blockchain Research Center (BRC), optimizing different SRMs.Our empirical findings suggest that various optimal portfolio allocations can be formulated to meet the unique risk appetites of individual investors.

These start-ups take on tasks and functions previously reserved for banks, such as ﬁnancing, asset management, and payments. In this article, we trace the transformation of the industry after digitalization. By using data on FinTech formations in Germany, we provide ﬁrst evidence that entrepreneurial dynamics in the FinTech sector are not so much driven by technology as by the educational and business background of the founders. Furthermore, we investigate the reactions of traditional banks to the emergence of these start-ups. In contrast with other emerging industries such as biotechnology, a network analysis shows that FinTechs have mostly engaged in strategic partnerships and only a few banks have acquired or obtained a ﬁnancial interest in a FinTech. We explain the restraint of traditional banks to fully endorse the new possibilities of digitalized ﬁnancial services with the characteristics of the technology itself and with the postponed fundamental decisions of banks to modernize their IT infrastructure.},

We find that this is unlikely. Equity bubbles are loud: price and volume go together as investors speculate on capital gains from reselling to more optimistic investors. But this resale option is limited for debt since its upside payoff is bounded. Debt bubbles then require an optimism bias among investors. But greater optimism leads to less speculative trading as investors view the debt as safe and having limited upside. Debt bubbles are hence quiet—high price comes with low volume.

This strategy makes sense if the poor are rate insensitive: then microlenders increase profitability (or achieve sustainability) without reducing the poor's access to credit.

The demand curves are downward sloping, and steeper for price increases relative to the lender's standard rates. We also find that loan size is far more responsive to changes in loan maturity than to changes in interest rates, which is consistent with binding liquidity constraints. (JEL G21, O16)},

Our model’s predictions closely match empirical data on asset pricing and ﬁrm behavior. The estimated bias parameters are well identiﬁed and exhibit plausible magnitudes.

To answer this question, we set up an incomplete markets model in which CRRA-utility investors are subject to aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks and have heterogeneous trading technologies. In our model, a large mass of passive investors do not re-balance their portfolio shares in response to aggregate shocks, while a smaller mass of active investors adjust their portfolio each period to respond to changes in the investment opportunity set. We ﬁnd that intermittent re-balancers amplify the eﬀect of aggregate shocks on the time variation in risk premia by a factor of four in a calibrated version of our model.},

Previous research finds that these stocks tend to be overpriced, but that prices correct downwards as uncertainty about earnings is resolved. Our analysis suggests that one reason mispricing has persisted through the years is that analyst disagreement coincides with high trading costs. We also show that in the cross-section, the less liquid stocks tend to be more severely overpriced. Additionally, increases in aggregate market liquidity accelerate the convergence of prices to fundamentals. As a result, returns of the initially overpriced stocks are negatively correlated with the time series of innovations in aggregate market liquidity.},

A full understanding of what happened in the financial crisis requires investigation into the plumbing of debt markets. During a financial crisis, when funds often cannot be raised easily or quickly, the fundamental values for certain assets can become separated for a time from market prices, with consequences that can echo into the real economy. This article will explain in concrete ways how debt markets can malfunction, with deleterious consequences for the real economy. After a quick overview of debt markets, I discuss three areas that are crucial in all debt markets decisions: risk capital and risk aversion; repo financing and haircuts; and counterparty risk. In each of these areas, feedback effects can arise so that less liquidity and a higher cost for finance can reinforce each other in a contagious spiral. I will document the remarkable rise in the premium that investors placed on liquidity during the crisis. Next, I will show how these issues caused debt markets to break down; indeed, fundamental values and market values seemed to diverge across several markets and products that were far removed from the “toxic” subprime mortgage assets at the root of the crisis. Finally, I will discuss briefly four steps that the Federal Reserve took to ease the crisis and how each was geared to a specific systemic fault that arose during the crisis.},

Arbitrageurs have constant relative riskaversion (CRRA) utility, while hedgers’ asset demand is independent of wealth.

Because arbitrageurs generate endogenous risk, an increase in their wealth or a reduction in their CRRA coefﬁcient can raise risk premia despite Sharpe ratios declining. Arbitrageur wealth is a priced risk factor because assets held by arbitrageurs offer high expected returns but suffer the most when wealth drops. Aggregate illiquidity, which declines in wealth, captures that factor.},

In the absence of the leverage constraint, the optimal strategy involves investing a fixed proportion of wealth in the risky asset. We prove that, in the presence of the leverage constraint, the optimal investment also involves investing a fixed proportion of wealth in the risky asset when the leverage constraint is not binding. However, the two proportions are different, reflecting the extent to which the investor alters his strategy even when the leverage constraint is not binding because of the possibility that the leverage constraint will become binding in the future.},

	abstract = {We build a model that helps to explain why increases in liquidity—such as lower bid–ask spreads, a lower price impact of trade, or higher turnover–predict lower subsequent returns in both ﬁrm-level and aggregate data. The model features a class of irrational investors, who underreact to the information contained in order ﬂow, thereby boosting liquidity. In the presence of short-sales constraints, high liquidity is a symptom of the fact that the market is dominated by these irrational investors, and hence is overvalued. This theory can also explain how managers might successfully time the market for seasoned equity offerings, by simply following a rule of thumb that involves issuing when the SEO market is particularly liquid. Empirically, we ﬁnd that: (i) aggregate measures of equity issuance and share turnover are highly correlated; yet (ii) in a multiple regression, both have incremental predictive power for future equal-weighted market returns.},

The default intensity, interest rate, and reference rate are assumed to be general deterministic functions of certain state variables, while these state variables jointly follow a jump-diffusion process, with drift and volatility coefficients governed by the regime and with jumps induced by shocks. We construct a risk-neutral pricing measure that prices all risk sources in an integrated manner. A rigorous verification of this pricing measure reveals the corresponding time-dependent market prices of these risk sources.

The way Rating Bias is priced changes signiﬁcantly between Investment Grade (IG) and Speculative Grade (SG) securities. Rating Bias is only partially discounted for IG tranches, whereas it is correctly priced for SG ones. Less sophisticated institutional investors are often restrained from investing in securities rated lower than triple-A, doubleA or A; however, these alternative thresholds do not appear to play a role as relevant as that of the IG–SG boundary. Rating Bias is also found to have an asymmetric impact on spreads: the relevance of actual over expected ratings is greater for tranches receiving evaluations that are higher (rather than lower) than expected. Taken together, these pieces of empirical evidence point toward ratings-based regulation as an important explanation for the observed mispricing of structured ﬁnance products.},

We find that CDO tranches have, on average, higher credit spreads than similarly rated CB, while investors are not compensated for facing higher systematic risk components in relation to investment-grade ABS and MBS. Our results also support the hypothesis of SF transactions as mechanisms of reducing funding costs: SF transactions’ weighted average spread is lower than that of comparable CB and originating firms’ creditworthiness does not deteriorate when compared to a sample of matched firms.},

	abstract = {Credit scoring is an important tool for banks and lending companies to realize credit risk exposure management and gain profits. GBDTs, a group of boosting-type ensemble algorithms, have shown promising improvement for credit scoring. However, GBDT improves the credit scoring performance by iteratively modifying only the fitting target for each base classifier and invariably works on the same features, which limits the diversity of individual classifiers in GBDT; Moreover, the performance-interpretability dilemma motivated a large number of works to focus on the pursuit of high-performance ensemble strategies, which leads to the lack of explorations on the interpretability of the credit scoring models. Based on the above limitations, two tree-based augmented GBDTs (AugBoost-RFS and AugBoost-RFU) are proposed in this work for credit scoring. In the proposed methods, a step-wise feature augmentation mechanism is introduced for GBDT to enrich the diversity of individual base classifiers; Tree-based embedding technologies simplify the process of feature augmentation and inherit interpretability of GBDT. Results on 4 large-scale credit scoring datasets show AugBoost-RFS/AugBoostRFU outperforms GBDT; Besides, supervised tree-based step-wise feature augmentation for GBDT achieves comparable results to neural network-based step-wise feature augmentation while significantly improve the augmentation efficiency. Moreover, the intrinsic global interpreted results and decision rules of tree-enhanced GBDTs, as well as the marginal contributions of features that are visualized by TreeSHAP demonstrate AugBoost-RFS/AugBoost-RFU can be good candidates for interpretable credit scoring.},

	abstract = {Evaluating a borrower's creditworthiness and enabling ethical lending practices are two of the most essential functions of credit scoring, making it an integral part of the economy. Credit risk management is an essential aspect of the financial industry, with the primary goal of minimising potential losses caused by customers failing to meet their credit responsibilities, such as fails to pay and bankruptcies. This risk is inherent in lending activities, where lenders extend credit to individuals or businesses. The traditional credit scoring approaches, which rely on statistical and machine learning techniques to analyse complex data and non-linear correlations in credit data has to be improved. Because the current financial sector lacks credit scoring, a deep learning network-based credit ranking model is presented in this research. This paper applies the complicated field of deep learning known as the stacked unidirectional and bidirectional long short-term memory model in the network to resolve credit scoring issues. Since scoring is not a time sequence issue, the suggested model uses the three-layer stacked LSTM and bidirectional LSTM architecture by modelling public datasets in a new way. Our suggested models beat state-of-the-art, considerably more difficult deep learning methods, proving that we could keep complexity to a minimum. The research findings indicate that the model demonstrates high levels of accuracy across various datasets. The model obtains an accuracy of 99.5\% on the Australian dataset, 99.4\% on the German dataset (categorical), 99.7\% on the German dataset (numerical), 99.2\% on the Japanese dataset, and 99.8\% on the Taiwanese dataset. These results highlight the robustness and effectiveness of the model in accurately predicting outcomes for different geographical regions.},

	abstract = {The paper develops a network-based framework to assess the impact of a firm's financial interconnections and interdependencies on it optimal hedging and risk transfer strategy. This is important consideration as risk concentrations and propagation embedded in risk transfers pose as a significant challenge for financial regulations and risk management. Using an a priori and an a posteriori analysis, we investigate the impact of the network structure on optimal hedge decisions and hedge efficacy. The a priori analysis shows that network features play an important role in determining corporate hedging decisions through their impact on hedge costs. In the a posteriori analysis for counterparty risk, benefit of modification from the a priori optimal hedge decision is realized when variance of firm value matters, but not when tail risk measures are utilized. Financial network assessment indicates that an a priori analysis is insufficient for robust hedging decisions, and choice of risk measures behind risk management objectives dictates the extent of impact of network characteristics.

	doi = {10.1016/j.physa.2019.121073},
	abstract = {Significant research has been performed on credit risk evaluation, with many machine learning and data mining techniques being employed for financial decision-making. The back propagation (BP) neural network has been a popular choice for credit risk evaluation problems, but many studies have found classifier ensembles to be superior to single classifiers. In this paper, a novel ensemble model based on the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) and a classifier optimisation technique is proposed for personal credit risk evaluation. To mitigate the negative effects of imbalanced datasets on the performance of the credit evaluation model, the SMOTE technique is used to rebalance the target training dataset. The particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm is employed to search for the best-connected weights and deviations in the BP neural networks. Based on the optimised BP neural network classifiers, an ensemble model is developed that combines the AdaBoost approach with the base classifiers. To ensure that the proposed model provides accurate and stable performance, we thoroughly explore and discuss the optimal parameters for the ensemble classification model. Finally, the proposed ensemble model is tested on German and Australian real-world imbalanced datasets. The results demonstrate that this model is more effective at processing credit data problems compared to the other classification models examined in this study. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

	doi = {10.1007/s10479-019-03283-2},
	abstract = {Most bankruptcy prediction models that have been analyzed in the literature, and that are estismated using ensemble-based techniques, are still not able to fully embody the true diversity of firm bankruptcy situations. Indeed, these models try to assess all bankruptcy situations either mostly using the same set of variables (bagging, boosting), or using the same set of observations (random subspace). In the first case, an ensemble assumes that any symptom of failure has the same origin. In the second case, it assumes that any financial situation that can lead to failure is the same for all firms. However, there are many situations where these two assumptions do not hold and where a state of bankruptcy may be specific to a given subgroup of firms or may be explained by a particular subset of variables. Certain methods, such as random forest or rotation forest, which combine the characteristics of both random subspace and bagging appear as solutions to this issue. However, they do not always perform significantly better than other ensemble models do. This is why we propose a modeling method that attempts to overcome the limitations of the previous models. It is based on a biclustering technique that seeks out groups of firms that are each characterized by a well-defined subset of variables and on an ensemble technique that is used to embody the full diversity of all bankruptcy situations that belong to each bicluster as precisely as possible. We show how the complementarity between these two techniques can improve forecasts.},

	abstract = {Enterprise evaluation provides indicators such as ratings and scores by analyzing the characteristics and capabilities of enterprises. The business performance, the level of credit risk, and the economic value of technology are quantitatively evaluated. Although the existing methods are well established, they need improvement in three aspects: fragmentation of information, interpretability of results, and objectivity of evaluation. First, existing methods selectively utilizes the information according to its own purpose. Second, it is hard for those results to understand the rationale of evaluation and the characteristics of enterprise. Third, unofficial information such as personal opinions or profit structures are included in the evaluation. Motivated by the limitations, we propose a machine learning-based enterprise evaluation method consisting of diversified quantification and semi-supervised learning. By quantifying various information, the analysis for identifying enterprise characteristics is primarily performed, and the results are derived as several remarkable features to improve interpret-ability. Then, by constructing the network, enterprises have compared each other, and they are objectively evaluated by label propagation on the enterprise network. The output is measured as a score, and later its distribution is binned into five grades to improve practicality and usefulness. The proposed method was applied to the dataset of 27,790 enterprises with 113 variables about financial and R\&D information. The results show clear identification of enterprise characteristics with the high accuracy of evaluation.},

Specifically, the parameter relating to the probability of switching to other agents has double effects on risk contagion in the firm-bank system, leading to a downward trend of banks' bad debt for lower values of this parameter and an upward trend for higher ones; while for the parameter denoting the fraction of guarantors that can be chosen by potential borrowers, bad debt is a non-monotonic function of this parameter, presenting a trend of an increase after a decrease. Finally, for the guarantee amplification parameter, bad debt presents an obvious upward trend with an increase of this parameter. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Among heterogeneous networks, there exist obviously and closely interdependent linkages. Unlike existing research primarily focus on the theoretical research of physical interdependent network model. We propose a two-layer interdependent network model based on two-mode networks to explore the interdependent features in the reality. Specifically, we construct a two-layer interdependent loan network and develop several dependent features indices. The model is verified to enable us to capture the loan dependent features of listed companies based on loan behaviors and shared shareholders. Taking Chinese debit and credit market as case study, the main conclusions are: (1) only few listed companies shoulder the main capital transmission (20\% listed companies occupy almost 70\% dependent degree). (2) The control of these key listed companies will be more effective of avoiding the spreading of financial risks. (3) Identifying the companies with high betweenness centrality and controlling them could be helpful to monitor the financial risk spreading. (4) The capital transmission channel among Chinese financial listed companies and Chinese non-financial listed companies are relatively strong. However, under greater pressure of demand of capital transmission (70\% edges failed), the transmission channel, which constructed by debit and credit behavior, will eventually collapse.

Three types of information pertaining to the borrowers are separately employed for their relations, namely loan information, credit history information, and soft information.

	abstract = {The micro-evolutionary mechanisms of credit repair (CR) knowledge dissemination among the public is crucial for the design of CR mechanisms and the healthy growth of China's social credit environment. However, previous research has seldom focused on CR knowledge dissemination. Knowledge dissemination would be influenced by knowledge benefits, government incentives, dissemination costs, and social credit risk. To study the impact of these factors on CR knowledge dissemination, we built an evolutionary game model of CR knowledge dissemination based on complex networks. This model includes agents as network nodes with different degrees of credit knowledge and a willingness to share information. Through numerical simulations, this study examines the impact of these factors on CR knowledge dissemination, demonstrating that improving the public's learning abilities is a powerful and effective way to promote CR knowledge dissemination. Compared with other influencing factors, the promotional effect of learning ability was more prominent. To ensure public motivation for knowledge dissemination, dissemination costs must be maintained at low levels. Additionally, the risk to the social credit environment has a significant impact on the effectiveness of dissemination, and high credit environment risk can hinder the dissemination of credit knowledge. Particularly, a high-risk environment can easily lead to the failure of government incentives.},

Such network model is based on imperfect information considering that the initial credit default of the debt bank will cause the creditor bank to run on its debt bank and the debt bank’s fire sale of external assets held to repay the debt or control the leverage ratio that reduce asset prices and create spillovers. By the theoretical deduction and simulation method, we study how the contagion effects of credit risk accumulate and spread in the interbank market network. In addition, we study the evolution characteristics of credit risk contagion caused by the initial default of debt banks in the interbank market. The following are the results of the study. First, when banks sell external assets at a fixed price, the fire sale of external assets can effectively reduce the probability of credit default. However, when the price of external assets decrease with the increase of fire sales volume, banks’ fire sale of external assets will lead to more serious contagion spillover consequences than that of none of the banks’ selling strategies. Second, the panic of bank decision makers in the banking system has a nonlinear evolution characteristic of increasing and decreasing credit risk contagion. Third, the higher the proportion of banks’ liquid assets, the stronger their ability to resist credit risks. Last, the higher the proportion of banks’ interbank assets, the stronger the contagion effect of credit risk on the entire banking system.},

In this context, this paper relies on data acquired from smartphones in a loan classiﬁcation problem. We conduct a set of experiments concerning feature selection, strategies to deal with imbalanced datasets and algorithm choice, to deﬁne a baseline model. This model is, then, compared to others adding network features to the original ones. For that comparison, we generate a network that links a given user to its phone book contacts which are users of a given mobile application, taking into account the ethics and privacy concerns involved, and use some feature extraction techniques, such as the introduction of centrality measures and the deﬁnition of node embeddings, in order to capture certain aspects of the network’s topology. Several node embedding algorithms are tested, but only Node2Vec proves to be signiﬁcantly better than the baseline model, applying Friedman’s post hoc tests. This node embedding algorithm outperforms all the other, representing a relative improvement, in comparison with the baseline model, of 5.74\% on the mean accuracy, 7.13\% on the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and 30.83\% on the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic scores. This method, therefore, proves to be very promising when trying to discriminate between “good” and “bad” customers, in credit scoring classiﬁcation problems.},

We propose a framework for quantifying relational risk based on publicly available risk events for SMEs’ credit risk evaluation. Our proposed framework quantifies relational risk by weighting the impact of publicly available risk events of each firm in an interfirm network—considering the impact of interfirm network type, risk event type, and time dependence of risk events—and combines the relational risk score with financial and demographic features to evaluate SMEs credit risk. Our results reveal that relational risk score significantly improves both discrimination and granting performances of credit risk evaluation of SMEs, providing valuable managerial and practical implications for financial institutions.},

	abstract = {Banks and firms play pivotal roles within the financial system and serve as primary channels for systemic risk contagion. While progress has been made in understanding risk contagion within financial network systems, many studies tend to overlook the intricate interplay of multichannel risk transmission and the dynamic evolution of network structures. Leveraging complex network theory, we have developed a dynamic multi-layer financial network risk transmission model that encompasses traditional bank–firm lending relationships and incorporates dynamic short-term loans. Through our analysis of various parameters such as loan recovery ratios, crossshareholding ratios, network structures, short-term loan ratios, and attack strategies, we have made significant observations: In scenarios where both the interbank lending network and crossshareholding network among firms exhibit random network structure, the financial network presents the highest level of risk. Excessive deviations in network average degrees, either too high or too low, can also heighten network vulnerability. An increase in the recovery ratio of interbank loans and the cross-shareholding ratio among firms corresponds to an escalation in systemic risk. Nodes with higher lending assets, more liquid assets, greater total assets, or higher out-degrees within the network become significant contributors to an elevated network bankruptcy rate when subjected to targeted attacks. Notably, the dynamic short-term loan network significantly amplifies systemic risks, with this amplification effect intensifying as the scale of short-term loans increases. From both macro and micro perspectives, our findings furnish regulatory authorities with novel analytical tools and insights to effectively mitigate and manage systemic risks in the financial sector.},

We use data on cross-border syndicated loans intended to build heterogeneous credit networks among banking sectors in various countries to explore the introduction of banking risks into the network. Via social network analysis (SNA), we find that the global credit network has phased characteristics, and it is a source of exposure to global banking risks. However, the more important network position, that is, the greater centrality, identified shows that the banking industry is more stable. To explain these findings, we present and estimate the banking risk contagion model and the suppression effect model of contagion. Evidence suggests that the international credit network is the channel of risk contagion, and the long-term loan network and nonfinancial borrower network have a stronger contagion effect. Exogenous banking supervision and network endogenous closeness centrality can inhibit risk contagion. From a policy perspective, these findings indicate the need to supervise high-risk cross-border loans and maintain independence in the international credit network.},

	abstract = {We estimate the evolution of credit risk linkages in an international banking network of 46 advanced and emerging market economies between January 2000 and December 2019. In our study, credit risk is proxied with the aggregate probability of default (PD) in the banking sector, and cross-country linkages are described by two types of networks: one representing predictive Granger relationships between the PD measures, and the other representing contemporaneous partial correlations. During the Global Financial Crisis and its aftermath, the density of the networks appears the highest, while experiencing a substantial decline in the post-crisis period triggered by massive deleveraging and the implementation of prudential measures. Throughout the whole observation period, the causal network exhibits the small-world pattern which tends to fuel risk propagation within the network, and the increasing degree of dissortativity which exerts a countervailing effect. On the country level, we document the centrality of the major Asian economies’ banking sectors and France, whereas the role of the USA, the UK and Germany appears moderate, which contrasts with the extant literature. Overall, from the policymaking perspective, our findings indicate that credit risk linkages in the international banking networks can notably differ from the relationships derived from cross-country bank claims.},

Application scoring is used to decide whether to grant a loan or not, while behavioral scoring is used mainly for portfolio management and to take preventive actions in case of default signals. In both cases, social network data has recently been shown to be valuable to increase the predictive power of these models, especially when the borrower’s historical data is scarce or not available. This study aims to understand the dynamics of creditworthiness assessment performance and how it is influenced by credit history, repayment behavior, and social network features. To accomplish this, we build up a machine learning classification framework demonstrating its value analyzing 97,000 individuals and companies from the moment they obtained their first loan up to 12 months afterward. Our original and massive dataset allowed us to characterize each borrower according to its credit behavior, and socioeconomic relationships. Our study finds that credit scoring based on borrowers’ history improves performance at a decreasing rate during the first six months and then stabilizes. The most notable effect on the performance of credit scoring based on social network features occurs in loan applications; for personal scoring, this effect prevails for approximately six months, while for business scoring, social network features add value throughout the entire study period. These findings are of great value to improve credit risk management and optimize the combined use of both the traditionally exploited information and new alternative data sources.},

The banking system is built as a network of heterogeneous banks which are connected with one another. In such a system, single credit events propagate through the interbank market from debtors to creditors and across the system. The shock is imposed as an unexpected event. We demonstrate that while idiosyncratic shocks cannot substantially disturb the banking system, a systemic shock of even a moderate magnitude can be highly detrimental. Such shock includes a huge contagious potential. We demonstrate that the costs of the shock are largely determined by the extent of contagion and range from negligible to catastrophic. The results imply that a severe crisis has to be initiated by a systemic shock of at least moderate magnitude. Capital ratio and the bank size are two additional factors of the banking system stability. Finally, credit risk analysis is sensitive to the network topology and exhibits a profound nonlinear characteristic.},

One of the most common problems is caused by credit. This paper addresses the issues such as credit problems and existing risks of online platforms by proposing a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) that is used to establish a credit risk assessment model for the P2P network lending platform. It provides a new idea for the credit risk assessment of online lending platforms. The paper uses Lu Jinfu as an example to evaluate its credit risk and selects two other platforms to rank its credit risk. The results show that the fuzzy cognitive map considers the mutual inﬂuence and feedback between the indicators. The index weight matrix learned by historical data represents the relationship between the indicators. After inputting the initial data into the inference, the index data reaches a steady state. The steady-state refers to the state that we expect the indicator to reach after a certain period. As an objective evaluating method for the credit risk of the P2P network lending platform, the proposed method has demonstrated its advantage and effectiveness.},

Thus, financial institutions have relied on stressed correlations or alternative copulas with more extreme tail dependence.

	abstract = {Credit scoring has been attracting increasing attention in the Chinese consumer financial industry. Traditional approaches are easily influenced by sample selection bias because they use accepted applicant samples only, while the applicant population also includes rejected applicants. Reject inference is a technique to infer good/bad labels for rejected applicants, which can overcome biases in credit scoring. However, previously proposed reject inference methods usually ignore the imbalanced distribution in accepted data, which means that good applicants are much more than bad ones in most practical consumer loan applications. Both the neglect of rejected data and the imbalanced distribution in accepted data weaken the performance of current credit scoring models. In this paper, we propose a novel reject inference framework that takes into account the imbalanced data distribution for consumer credit scoring. First, we use an advanced graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm to solve the reject inference problem, which is called label spreading. Second, faced with an imbalanced distribution of good and bad samples in accepted applicants, we conduct imbalanced learning using a modified Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique before reject inference. Then, six binary classifiers are studied in our proposed framework for credit scoring modeling. Finally, we present the results of four exact experiments as well as online A/B tests for performance evaluation using data provided by a leading Chinese fintech company. Empirical results indicate that the proposed framework performs better than traditional scoring models across different evaluation metrics, representing a progressive method that promotes credit scoring research as well as improving fintech practices.},

SME credit risk assessment is a critical part in the SCF system. The diffusion of SME credit risk may cause serious consequences, leading the whole supply chain finance system unstable and insecure. Compared with traditional credit risk assessment models, the supply chain relationship, credit condition of SME, and core enterprises should all be considered to rate SME credit risk in SCF. Traditional methods mix all indicators from different index systems. They cannot give a quantitative result on how these index systems work. Furthermore, traditional credit risk assessment models are heavily dependent on the number of annotated SME data. However, it is implausible to accumulate enough credit risky SMEs in advance. In this paper, we propose an adaptive heterogenous multiview graph learning method to tackle the small sample size problem for SMEs’ credit risk forecasting. Three graphs are constructed by using indicators from supply chain operation, SME financial indicator, and nonfinancial indicator individually. All the graphs are integrated in an adaptive manner, providing a quantitative explanation on how the three parts cooperate. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed method has good performance for determining whether SME is risky or nonrisky in SCF. From the perspective of SCF, SME financing ability is still the main factor to determine the credit risk of SME.},

	abstract = {In networked-loans, guarantor enterprises have a legal duty to repay debt to the commercial bank when the guaranteed borrower enterprise defaults (fail to repay). During an economic recession, the risk of defaults may spread like wildﬁre – the loan network structure could amplify both reach and impact; thus leading to a large-scale corporation defaults even systemic ﬁnancial crises. The Central Bank urges advanced regulation technology to recognize and act on the contagion risk in order to avoid the “gray rhino”. Therefore, we present a novel approach to help the regulators quantify the systemic risk and provide stemming clues. In particular, we report a state-of-the-art graph neural network architecture (iConReg) for detecting and isolating of contagion risk in China’s nationalwide networked-loans. The overall accuracy of our model reaches over 91\% of AUC (Area under the ROC Curve), which considerably outperforms the compared benchmark methods. By isolating the top 1\% of predicted high-risky nodes in the contagion chains, iConReg reports a signiﬁcant shrink (averaged 25.8\%) of loan default rates. Moreover, we conduct extensive case and user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method and the result also demonstrates its superior performance. Our presented approach opens up a new direction of using deep graph learning techniques to regulate the contagion risk of networked-loans, which enables the authorities to design more prompt prevention measures against systemic ﬁnancial crises.},

Nevertheless, intensifying market rivalry and evolving industry conditions, agricultural input companies are encountering a growing number of obstacles and constraints, particularly in the areas of cost management and financial risk mitigation. This study aimed to improve agricultural input enterprises' management efficiency and competitiveness by exploring a cost analysis and financial warning method based on graph neural networks. We analyzed the importance of cost analysis for these enterprises and used graph neural networks to optimize cost problems by integrating Bayesian graph neural networks. This directly affected the profitability and competitive advantage of the enterprises. By conducting in-depth research on different cost factors and their impact on the economic performance of enterprises, a comprehensive understanding of the cost structure was provided. The article tried to improve existing financial early warning methods for agricultural input enterprises based on graph neural networks, utilizing the rich financial data and relationship information of graph neural networks to effectively identify financial risk factors and provide corresponding early warning models. The results of this study provided useful reference and inspiration for managers and decision-makers, promoting the sustainable development of agricultural input enterprises.},

	abstract = {Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs) are essential for the growth and development of the country’s economy, as they create jobs, generate income, and foster production and innovation. In recent years, credit risk assessment (CRA) has been an essential process used by financial institutions to evaluate the creditworthiness of MSMEs and determine the likelihood of default. Traditionally, CRA has relied on credit scores and financial statements, but with the advent of machine learning (ML) algorithms, lenders have a new tool at their disposal. By and large, ML algorithms are designed to classify borrowers based on their credit history and transactional data while leveraging the entity relationship involved in credit transactions. This study introduces an innovative knowledge graph-driven credit risk assessment model (RGCN-RF) based on the Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) and Random Forest (RF) algorithm. RGCN is employed to identify topological structures and relationships, which is currently nascent in traditional credit risk assessment methods. RF categorises MSMEs based on the enterprise embedding vector generated from RGCN. Extensive experimentation is conducted to assess model performance utilising the Indian MSMEs database. The balanced accuracy of 92\% obtained using the RGCN-RF model demonstrates a considerable advancement over prior techniques in identifying risk-free enterprises.},

	abstract = {Thin-file borrowers are customers for whom a creditworthiness assessment is uncertain due to their lack of credit history. To address missing credit information, many researchers have used borrowers’ social interactions as an alternative data source. Exploiting social networking data has traditionally been achieved by hand-crafted feature engineering, but lately, graph neural networks have emerged as a promising alternative. Here we introduce an information-processing framework to improve credit scoring models by blending several methods of graph representation learning: feature engineering, graph embeddings, and graph neural networks. In this approach, we aggregate the methods’ outputs to be fed to a gradient boosting classifier to produce a final creditworthiness score. We have validated this framework over a unique multi-source dataset that characterizes the relationships, interactions, and credit history for the entire population of a Latin American country, applying it to credit risk models, application, and behavior. It also allows us to study both individuals and companies. Our results show that the methods of graph representation learning should be used as complements; they should not be seen as self-sufficient methods, as it is currently done. We improve the creditworthiness assessment performance in terms of the measures of Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) and Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS), outperforming traditional methods of exploiting social interaction data. In the area of corporate lending, where the potential gain is much higher, our results confirm that the evaluation of a thin-file company cannot solely consider the company’s own characteristics. The business ecosystem in which these companies interact with their owners, suppliers, customers, and other companies provides novel knowledge that enables financial institutions to enhance their creditworthiness assessment. Our results let us know when and on which population to use graph data and the expected effects on performance. They also show the enormous value of graph data on the credit scoring problem for thin-file borrowers, mainly to help companies with thin or no credit history to enter the financial system.},

Previous methods usually construct enterprise representations by credit-related indicators, such as liquidity and staff quality. However, indicators of many enterprises are not accessible, especially for the small- and medium-sized enterprises. To alleviate the indicator deficiency, graph learning based methods are proposed to enhance enterprise representation learning by the neighbor structure of enterprise graphs. However, existing methods usually only focus on pairwise relationships, and overlook the ubiquitous highorder relationships among enterprises, e.g., supply chain connecting multiple enterprises. To resolve this issue, we propose a Multi-Structure Cascaded Graph Neural Network framework (MS-CGNN) for ECR assessment. It enhances enterprise representation learning based on enterprise graph structures of different granularity, including knowledge graphs of pairwise relationships, homogeneous and heterogeneous hypergraphs of highorder relationships. To distinguish influences of different types of hyperedges, MS-CGNN redefine new type-dependent hyperedge weight matrices for heterogeneous hypergraph convolutions. Experimental results show that MS-CGNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world ECR datasets.},

However, these methods rarely consider the interaction among customers such as bank transfer and remittance. With rapid growth in the number of customers adopting online banking services, such interaction information plays a significant role in assessing their credit score. In this paper, we propose a novel scalable credit scoring approach called CDGAT (Graph attention network for credit card defaulters) for predicting potential credit card defaulters. In CDGAT, a customer’s credit score is calculated based on transaction embedding and neighborhood embedding. To obtain the neighborhood embedding, CDGAT first utilizes the Amount-bias Sampling (AbS) strategy to extract a subgraph for each customer. Next, CDGAT directly aggregates neighbors’ features according to their influence weights. The experimental results on the dataset from Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Macau) Limited (ICBC (Macau)) show that CDGAT significantly outperforms the baseline methods. Furthermore, experimental results reveal that the proposed method is also superior to several state-of-the-art Graph Convolutional Neural Network models in terms of scalability and performance.},

We build a computational model of platform lending that is used to study the endogenous loan network formation process on the platform. Given the multidimensional nature of financial inclusion, we address what factors influence the number of loans, the level of investment/debt, and how those relate to the distribution of investment/debt across agents. We find that platform scale and SME reach are essential in determining the number of loans on the platform. However, the willingness to accept risks is the main driver behind the value of those loans. We also find that increased platform scale, high-risk thresholds, and low-interest rates lead to more evenly distributed investments. Moreover, we find that large platforms help increase diversity and lead to a more evenly distributed power among peers. We conclude that digital platforms increase financial inclusion, helping to foster investment and achieve a more egalitarian allocation of resources. These results can guide new theory development about the impact of P2P lending on inequality as well as help platforms to promote financial inclusion.},

This approach first utilizes a Transformer encoder to extract the textual features from the loan description, and then combines them with the hard features derived from the loan application; together, they comprise the final features of a loan. Finally the combined features are fed into a two-layer feed-forward neural network to predict the loan's default probability. We perform empirical studies on two data sets of real transactions: LendingClub loan data from the American market and Renrendai loan data from the Chinese market. The results show that the model considering the textual loan description outperforms that which does not in terms of loan default prediction. Furthermore, the model is based on the Transformer encoder achieving the best performance under the AUC and G-mean metrics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Loan evaluation is an effective method for credit risk assessment in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending and significantly affects lender investment decisions as well as his/her profits. Besides traditional methods of loan evaluation, machine learning has gained increased attention and has achieved better performance for P2P lending, especially regarding the Random Forest approach. However, the loan evaluation model based on Random Forest aims to improve the overall accuracy, which cannot guarantee that the lender profit is maximized when the overall accuracy is maximized because the profits of each loan are different. To further improve the loan evaluation effect and lender profits, Random Forest optimized using a genetic algorithm with profit score (RFoGAPS) is proposed. First, considering the actual and potential returns and losses, a new profit score is proposed and taken as the optimization objective. Second, the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the combination of decision trees in Random Forest. Then, the dataset of Lending Club is used to evaluate the proposed method. Experimental results show that the RFoGAPS can obtain higher profits for lenders compared with actual profit and traditional methods. Some suggestions are proposed based on experimental results to facilitate the healthy development of P2P lending. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Loan evaluation is an effective tool for credit risk assessment in the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending market. However, most of the traditional loan evaluation models assume a balanced misclassification cost, which is far from business reality and leaves opportunities for investigating the cost-sensitive modelling approaches. Moreover, few existing studies consider the special characteristics of P2P lending. In this paper, we propose a cost-sensitive boosted tree loan evaluation model by incorporating cost-sensitive learning and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to enhance the capability of discriminating potential default borrowers. Therefore, a portfolio allocation model that converts the portfolio optimization problem into an integer linear programming is proposed as a decision support system for unprofessional lenders. Unlike existing studies, which mainly evaluate the model through accuracy-based metrics, this study measures the expected profitability based on the annualized rate of return (ARR) and proposes a new metric (ARR curve) reflecting the ARR over different rejection rates. Two real-world P2P lending datasets are examined, and explanatory data analysis shows that explanatory variables differ in predicting the probability of default and profitability. Experimental results reveal that the area under the ARR curve is not a considerable metric in evaluating models from a profit perspective. Conventional cost-insensitive models may even lead to negative returns, whereas the proposed loan evaluation and portfolio allocation model are the best performing methods over the two datasets in terms of profitability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

To this end, the concept of eXplainable AI (XAI) emerged introducing a suite of techniques attempting to explain to users how complex models arrived at a certain decision. For crosssectional data classical XAI approaches can lead to valuable insights about the models’ inner workings, but these techniques generally cannot cope well with longitudinal data (time series) in the presence of dependence structure and non-stationarity.

	abstract = {Corporate credit rating assessment is one of the crucial problems of credit risk management; it will help the financial institutions and government decide whether to issue debts. Recent studies focusing on the prediction of credit rating by using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have shown impressive results compared to traditional statistical methods. Although the AI techniques can be used to assess credit risk, the prediction accuracy is still worth improving further, as even a small improvement in credit rating prediction accuracy leads to significant loss reduction in the industry. In this paper, we propose new learning analytic methods to enhance the prediction accuracy of credit rating. First, we devise the metrics based on the credit rating history of the firms, and expand the feature space with new input variables. This approach can be applied to any conventional AI methods for improvement of prediction accuracy. Second, we develop a novel learning algorithm that is designed to take into account historical financial data. We propose the parallel artificial neural networks (PANNs) ensemble model that creates several independent artificial neural networks (ANNs); each ANN deals with financial performance of the firms for each year, and the final output of PANNs is aggregated by ensemble learning. In our experiment, three different real-world datasets are used to validate the performance of our proposed approach. Consequently, the experimental results show that our proposed approach achieved competitive results compared to conventional AI techniques. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Credit risk assessment is a crucial task in the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending industry. In recent years, ensemble learning methods have been verified to perform better in default prediction than individual classifiers and statistical techniques. Real-world loan datasets are imbalanced; however, most studies focus on enhancing overall prediction accuracy rather than improving the identification ability of real default loans. Moreover, some of the features that are significantly correlated with default rates are not attached importance in the model construction of previous studies. To fill these gaps, we propose a distance-to-model and adaptive clustering-based multi-view ensemble (DM–ACME) learning method for predicting default risk in P2P lending. In this method, multi-view learning and an adaptive clustering method are explored to produce an ensemble of diverse ensembles constituted by gradient boosting decision trees. A novel combination strategy called distance-to-model and a soft probability fashion are embedded for model integration. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed ensemble approach, comprehensive analysis on DM–ACME, comparative experiments with several state-of-the-art methods, and feature importance evaluation are conducted with the data provided by Lending Club. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method as well as indicate the importance of some features in loan default prediction. © 2020},

	abstract = {Machine learning is an emerging technique for building analytic models for machines to learn from data and be able to do predictive analysis. The ability of machines to learn and do predictive analysis is very important in this era of big data and it has a wide range of application areas. For instance, banks and financial institutions are sometimes faced with the challenge of what risk factors to consider when advancing credit/loans to customers. For several features/attributes of the customers are normally taken into consideration, but most of these features have little predictive e ect on the credit worthiness or otherwise of the customer. Furthermore, a robust and e ective automated bank credit risk score that can aid in the prediction of customer credit worthiness very accurately is still a major challenge facing many banks. In this paper, we examine a real bank credit data and conduct several machine learning algorithms on the data for comparative analysis and to choose which algorithms are the best fit for learning bank credit data. The algorithms gave over 80\% accuracy in prediction. Furthermore, the most important features that determine whether a customer will default or otherwise in paying his/her credit the next month are extracted from a total of 23 features. We then applied these most important features on some selected machine learning algorithms and compare their predictive accuracy with the other algorithms that used all the 23 features. The results show no significant di erence, signifying that these features can accurately determine the credit worthiness of the customers. Finally, we formulate a predictive model using the most important features to predict the credit worthiness of a given customer. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the emerging peer-to-peer (P2P) lending industry, risks such as credit risk and default risk will bring huge losses to online lending platforms and investors. Therefore, it is necessary to design a reasonable evaluation index system of credit risk to scientifically evaluate the risk level of borrowers. This paper studies the design of comprehensive evaluation index system for P2P credit risk of “three rural” (i.e., agriculture, rural areas and farmers) borrowers. Concretely, we construct the feature set for P2P credit risk of “three rural” borrowers. Based on the traditional index system, we add the static indexes specific to the agriculture-related borrowers and the dynamic indexes reflect the Internet as the preliminary indexes of the feature set and select the borrowers data of the “Pterosaur loan” platform as the research sample. Then, 35 borrower credit features are extracted as a feature set of credit risk. Then, we present a two-stage feature selection method based on filter and wrapper to select the main features from 35 initial borrower credit features. In the stage of filter, three filter methods are used to calculate the importance of the unbalanced features. In the stage of wrapper, a Lasso-logistic method is proposed to filter the feature subset through heuristic search algorithm. In the end, 21 main independent features are selected according to the classification accuracy, which constitute the evaluation index system of credit risk of “three rural” borrowers. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Most approaches that use ensemble learning paradigms toward sentiment analysis involve feature engineering in order to enhance the predictive performance. In response, we sought to develop a paradigm of a multiobjective, optimization-based weighted voting scheme to assign appropriate weight values to classifiers and each output class based on the predictive performance of classification algorithms, all to enhance the predictive performance of sentiment classification. The proposed ensemble method is based on static classifier selection involving majority voting error and forward search, as well as a multiobjective differential evolution algorithm. Based on the static classifier selection scheme, our proposed ensemble method incorporates Bayesian logistic regression, naïve Bayes, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and support vector machines as base learners, whose performance in terms of precision and recall values determines weight adjustment. Our experimental analysis of classification tasks, including sentiment analysis, software defect prediction, credit risk modeling, spam filtering, and semantic mapping, suggests that the proposed classification scheme can predict better than conventional ensemble learning methods such as AdaBoost, bagging, random subspace, and majority voting. Of all datasets examined, the laptop dataset showed the best classification accuracy (98.86\%). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction’s accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a uniﬁed framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identiﬁcation of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class uniﬁes six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this uniﬁcation, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

In the prediction of financially distressed, two-stage hybrid model giving the best performance of 80.0\% using cross-validation approach and demonstrates stronger prediction power than conventional logistic regression, logarithm logistic regression, and ANN approaches.

Several approaches have been proposed, however, they paid little attention on the various underlying relationships between users, which can provide significant improvement.

These data provide a comprehensive representation of users’ overall status, including historical financial credit, recent financial credit and wealth status. Different graphs are constructed based on the similarities between users using these data, respectively. Then, for graphs, GAT modules are used to capture both the relationships with adjacent and high-order neighbors, as well as the linear and non-linear relationships. After fusing learned high-level features from GAT modules, final predictive results, whether users will default or not, are predicted.

The general paradigm of previous works usually conducts supervised classification with internal information (credit attributes) of instances, while recent studies have introduced external information like texts, images, relations, to improve predictive accuracy. However, how to improve forecasting without explicit external relations still needs to be explored. Motivated by this and also by the increasing popularity of Graph Neural Network (GNN) with its fast infiltration into other disciplines, we propose an integrated graph representation learning approach to realize improved credit risk prediction. It includes two stages: (i) treat instances as nodes and use kNN to extract and construct edges; (ii) implement GNN models to discriminate risk/default cases by node classification. In this way, both ‘‘unsupervised’’ graph transformation and ‘‘supervised’’ node classification have been integrated to formulate the hybrid kNN–GNN model, and experiments on widely-used credit datasets demonstrate its outperformance over direct classification by conventional machine learning techniques. Sensitivity of hyperparameter 𝑘 indicating different graph sparsity is also analyzed to reveal its optimal selection. Furthermore, ensemble multi-graphs and introduce edge weights are examined to investigate possible advancements with some enhancements observed for both, providing feasible ways to extend the upper bound of this hybrid model’s performances. Our findings exhibit valid improvements in credit risk prediction under the circumstance of only internal information available, and in depth present the future prospects of innovative integrations and applications of GNN methods in dealing with many other operational research tasks.},

Speciﬁcally, we propose a novel classiﬁcation methodology for ML-driven credit risk algorithms and their performance ranking using public datasets. We further discuss the challenges including data imbalance, dataset inconsistency, model transparency, and inadequate utilization of deep learning models. The results of our review show that: 1) most deep learning models outperform classic machine learning and statistical algorithms in credit risk estimation, and 2) ensemble methods provide higher accuracy compared with single models.

There is a tendency in corporate credit risk prediction that more and more features are considered in the pre­ diction system. However, this often brings redundant and irrelevant information which greatly impairs the performance of prediction algorithms. Therefore, this study proposes an HDNN algorithm that is an improved deep neural network (DNN) algorithm and can be used for high dimensional prediction of corporate credit risk. We firstly theoretically proved that there was no regularization effect when L1 regularization was added to the batch normalization layer of the DNN, which was a hidden rule in the industrial implementation but never been proved. In addition, we proved that adding L2 constraints on a single L1 regularization can solve the issue. Finally, this study analyzed a case study of credit data with supply chain and network data to show the supe­ riority of the HDNN algorithm in the scenario of a high dimensional dataset.},

Furthermore, we observe that the LightGBM algorithm based on multiple observational data set classiﬁcation prediction results is the best. The average performance rate of the historical transaction data of the Lending Club platform rose by 1.28 percentage points, which reduced loan defaults by approximately \$117 million. Finally, with respect to the inﬂuencing factors of the default rate, suggested developments for the Lending club and other P2P platforms are provided as is the suggested direction of other countries’ development in this ﬁeld.},

	abstract = {In recent years, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending in China, which is a new form of unsecured financing that uses the Internet, has boomed, but the consequent credit risk problems are inevitable. A key challenge facing P2P lending platforms is accurately predicting the default probability of the borrower of each loan using the default prediction model, which effectively helps the P2P lending platform avoid credit risks. The traditional default prediction model based on machine learning and statistical learning does not meet the needs of P2P lending platforms in terms of default risk prediction because for data-driven P2P lending, credit data have a large number of missing values, are high-dimensional and have class-imbalanced problems, which makes it difficult to effectively train the default risk prediction model. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a new default risk prediction model based on heterogeneous ensemble learning. Three individual classifiers, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), a deep neural network (DNN) and logistic regression (LR), are used simultaneously with a liner weight ensemble strategy. In particular, this model is able to process missing values. After generating discrete and rank features, this model adds missing values to the model for self-training. Then, the hyperparameters are optimized by the XGBoost model to improve the performance of the prediction model. Finally, compared with the benchmark model, the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy of the prediction results. In conclusion, the prediction method proposed in this paper solves the class-imbalanced problem. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Credit risk evaluation is an integral part of any lending process, and even more so for financial institutions involved in lending to SMEs. The importance of credit scoring has increased recently because of the financial crisis and increased capital requirements for banks. There are, however, only few studies that develop credit coring models for SME lending. The objective of this study is to introduce a novel, more accurate credit risk estimation approach for SMEs business lending. Based on traditional statistical methods and recent artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, we proposed a hybrid model which combines the logistic regression approach and artificial neural networks (ANN). In order to test the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed hybrid model, we use the data of Finnish SMEs from the fiscal years 2004 to 2012. Our results suggest that the proposed ANN/logistic hybrid model is more accurate than either of the initial models ANN or logistic regression. This improvement in the accuracy of the credit scoring model decreases evaluation errors and has thereby many potential practical implications. First of all, a more accurate credit scoring model can result in better performance of the whole SME loan portfolio. Second, it can also result in lower capital requirements from the banks perspective and lower interest rates from the individual firm's perspective. Combined, these effects will enhance the banks competitiveness in the market for SME loans. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending transactions take place by the lenders choosing a borrower and lending money. It is important to predict whether a borrower can repay because the lenders must bear the credit risk when the borrower defaults, but it is difficult to design feature extractors with very complex information about borrowers and loan products. In this paper, we present an architecture of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for predicting the repayment in P2P social lending to extract features automatically and improve the performance. CNN is a deep learning model for classifying complex data, which extracts discriminative features automatically by convolution operation on lending data. We classify the borrower's loan status by capturing the robust features and learning the patterns. Experimental results with 5-fold cross-validation show that our method automatically extracts complex features and is effective in repayment prediction on Lending Club data. In comparison with other machine learning methods, the standard CNN has achieved the highest performance with 75.86\%. Exploiting various CNN models such as Inception, ResNet, and Inception-ResNet results in the state-of-the-art performance of 77.78\%. We also demonstrate that the features extracted by our model are better performed by projecting the samples into the feature space. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {An extended approach proposed in this paper is to make a more reasonable assessment of personal default risk in peer to peer (P2P) online lending platform, which reduces uncertainty while taking into account the psychological characteristics of lenders to avoid risk. The TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multi-criteria decision making) approach, which can describe the psychological behaviors of decision maker, has been proved to be effective to solve multi-attribute decision making (MADM) problems. The definitions of dual hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy set (DHPFS) and the processes of traditional TODIM approach are firstly introduced in this paper. Then, the TODIM approach is extended to solve the MADM problems with a dual hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy number (DHPFN). Finally, a case study evaluating the personal default risk in P2P online lending is conducted to demonstrate that the proposed approach is applicable to solve MADM problems. In addition, some comparative analyses are performed to compare the dual hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy TODIM method with the other two integrated operators of DHPFS. Through the comparisons, we conclude that the advantage of the proposed method over other methods is that it reduces uncertainty while taking into account the psychological characteristics of lenders to avoid risk. Today's credit environment is fraught with risks, and the psychological behaviors of decision makers are important factors that cannot be ignored. For these reasons, the dual Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy TODIM method is applicable for evaluating personal default risk. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The purpose was to help investment banks select customers with good credit, exclude customers with greater risk, minimize the risk of investors, and maintain the maximum interests of investors. The data mining technology was used to establish a credit risk assessment model of personal to personal peer-to-peer (P2P) network lending, and then the credit situation of the lender was accurately assessed to reduce the risk of the platform. Firstly, the loan data of LendingClub (LC) platform in 2018 were collected and sorted out, and then the unbalanced data set was obtained through preprocessing. Secondly, the unbalanced data set was sampled by layers, and 10 balanced data sets were obtained, and the four indexes of evaluation were obtained through data classification, that is, P2P platform credit rating evaluation index. Finally, the actual data of LC platform were evaluated by decision tree and binomial logic regression algorithm. The CfsSubsetEval evaluation strategy and BestFirst search strategy were used to search for a single feature to improve the prediction ability, so as to analyze the credit rating of the lender. The research results showed that the decision tree algorithm could improve the accuracy of preliminary screening, and predict the default probability of borrowers more accurately, so as to filter out the borrowers with higher default rate and reduce the loan risk of the platform, while the binomial logistic regression algorithm could show good performance. The combination of the two algorithms can truly estimate the credit status of the lenders and improve the transaction efficiency. Therefore, the research on the credit risk of blockchain platform based on data mining technology is of great significance to improve the credit level of investors, improve their investment income, save transaction costs, optimize the allocation of credit resources, and achieve effective supervision by credit regulatory authorities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

To test this, we empirically compare ELM to established scoring techniques according to three performance criteria: ease of use, resource consumption, and predictive accuracy. The mathematical roots of ELM suggest that they are especially suitable as a base model within ensemble classifiers. Therefore, to obtain a holistic picture of their potential, we assess ELM in isolation and in conjunction with different ensemble frameworks. The empirical results confirm the conceptual advantages of ELM and indicate that they are a valuable alternative to other credit risk modelling methods. © 2017},

Recent industry surveys often mention that uncertainty about how supervisors might assess these risks could be a barrier to innovation. In this study, we propose a new framework to quantify model risk-adjustments to compare the performance of several ML methods. To address this challenge, we first harness the internal ratings-based approach to identify up to 13 risk components that we classify into 3 main categories—statistics, technology, and market conduct. Second, to evaluate the importance of each risk category, we collect a series of regulatory documents related to three potential use cases—regulatory capital, credit scoring, or provisioning—and we compute the weight of each category according to the intensity of their mentions, using natural language processing and a risk terminology based on expert knowledge. Finally, we test our framework using popular ML models in credit risk, and a publicly available database, to quantify some proxies of a subset of risk factors that we deem representative. We measure the statistical risk according to the number of hyperparameters and the stability of the predictions. The technological risk is assessed through the transparency of the algorithm and the latency of the ML training method, while the market conduct risk is quantified by the time it takes to run a post hoc technique (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the output.},

We introduce a topic model to extract valuable features from the descriptive text concerning loans and construct four default prediction models to demonstrate the performance of these features for default prediction. Moreover, a two-stage method is designed to select an effective feature set containing both soft and hard information. An empirical analysis using real-word data from a major P2P lending platform in China shows that the proposed method can improve loan default prediction performance compared with existing methods based only on hard information.},

	abstract = {With the unprecedented increase in data all over the world, financial sector such as companies and industries try to remain competitive by transforming themselves into data-driven organizations. By analyzing a huge amount of financial data, companies are able to obtain valuable information to determine their strategic plans such as risk control, crisis management, or growth management. However, as the amount of data increase dramatically, traditional data analytic platforms confront with storing, managing, and analyzing difficulties. Emerging Big Data Analytics (BDA) overcome these problems by providing decentralized and distributed processing. In this study, we propose two new models for default prediction. In the first model, called DPModel-1, statistical (lo­ gistic regression), and machine learning methods (decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting) are employed to predict company default. Derived from the first model, we propose DPModel-2 based on graph theory. DPModel-2 also comprises new variables obtained from the trading interactions of companies. In both models, grid search optimization and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value are utilized in order to determine the best hyperparameters and make the models interpretable, respectively. By leveraging balance sheet, credit, and invoice datasets, default prediction is realized for about one million companies in Turkey between the years 2010–2018. The default rates of companies range between 3\%-6\% by year. The experimental results are con­ ducted on a BDA platform. According to the DPModel-1 results, the highest AUC score is ensured by random forest with 0.87. In addition, the results are improved for each technique separately by adjusting new variables with graph theory. According to DPModel-2 results, the best AUC score is achieved by random forest with 0.89.},

Three types of information pertaining to the borrowers are separately employed for their relations, namely loan information, credit history information, and soft information.

Due to the complexity of human behaviors and changing social environments, the distributions of ﬁnancial data are usually complex and it is challenging to ﬁnd clusters and give reasonable interpretations. The goal of this study is to develop an integrated approach to detect clusters in ﬁnancial data, and optimize the scope of the clusters such that the clusters can be easily interpreted. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst proposed a new cluster quality evaluation criterion, which is free from large-scale computation and can guide base clustering algorithms such as k-Means to detect hyperellipsoidal clusters adaptively. Then, we designed a new solver for a revised support vector data description model, which efﬁciently reﬁnes the centroids and scopes of the detected clusters to make the clusters tighter such that the data in the clusters share greater similarities, and thus, the clusters can be easily interpreted with eigenvectors. Using ten ﬁnancial datasets, the experiments showed that the proposed algorithm can efﬁciently ﬁnd reasonable number of clusters. The proposed approach is suitable for large-scale ﬁnancial datasets whose features are meaningful, and also applicable to ﬁnancial mining tasks, such as data distribution interpretation and anomaly detection.},

I use proprietary data provided by one of the biggest Dutch P2P lending platforms, on which personal acquaintances of the borrower are able to invest before other P2P investors do. I find that P2P investors invest more in loans of borrowers to whom they are personally acquainted. More initial investment by investors acquainted with the borrower is subsequently associated with a higher likelihood of obtaining a second loan from the P2P lender, larger investments by other P2P investors and lower ex post defaults. These results are consistent with informal lenders having superior information or monitoring skills and rational herding following informal investors’ investment decisions.},

We also simulate systemic shocks such as individual bank shocks, industry shocks, and macroeconomic shocks with the aim of identifying systemically important banks and industries. The results found that China’s four largest state-owned commercial banks are the systemically important banks, and the banks’ loan balances in manufacturing, transportation and other industries and personal credit should be the focus of attention. This study can feedback more correlations in the banking system, emphasizing the importance of research on multilayer network contagion mechanisms, and the content and findings of the study can provide empirical corroboration for systemic risk regulation.},

However, these solutions fail to exploit multiplex relations existed in the financial scenarios and ignore the key intrinsic properties of the loan default detection, i.e., communicability, complementation and induction. To address these issues, we develop a novel attributed multiplex graph based loan default detection approach for effectively integrating multiplex relations in financial scenarios. Considering the complexity of financial scenario, an Attributed Multiplex Graph (AMG) is proposed to jointly model various relations and objects as well as the rich attributes on nodes and edges. We elaborately design relation-specific receptive layers equipped with adaptive breadth function to incorporate important information derived from local structure in each aspect of AMG and stack multiple propagation layer to explore the high-order connectivity information. Furthermore, a relation-specific attention mechanism is adopted to emphasize relevant information during end-to-end training. Extensive experiments conducted on the large-scale realworld dataset verify the effectiveness of the proposed model compared with state of arts. Moreover, AMG-DP has also achieved a performance improvement of 9.37\% on KS metric in recent months after successful deployment in the Alipay APP.},

	abstract = {Contact network analysis has become a vital tool for conceptualizing the spread of pathogens in animal populations and is particularly useful for understanding the implications of heterogeneity in contact patterns for transmission. However, the transmission of most pathogens cannot be simpliﬁed to a single mode of transmission and, thus, a single deﬁnition of contact. In addition, host-pathogen interactions occur in a community context, with many pathogens infecting multiple host species and most hosts being infected by multiple pathogens. Multilayer networks provide a formal framework for researching host-pathogen systems in which multiple types of transmission-relevant interactions, deﬁned as network layers, can be analyzed jointly. Here, we provide an overview of multilayer network analysis and review applications of this novel method to epidemiological research questions. We then demonstrate the use of this technique to analyze heterogeneity in direct and indirect contact patterns amongst swine farms in the United States. When contact among nodes can be deﬁned in multiple ways, a multilayer approach can advance our ability to use networks in epidemiological research by providing an improved approach for deﬁning epidemiologically relevant groups of interacting nodes and changing the way we identify epidemiologically important individuals such as superspreaders.},

	abstract = {Microloan markets allow individual borrowers to raise funding from multiple individual lenders. We use a unique panel data set that tracks the funding dynamics of borrower listings on Prosper.com, the largest microloan market in the United States. We find evidence of rational herding among lenders. Well-funded borrower listings tend to attract more funding after we control for unobserved listing heterogeneity and payoff externalities. Moreover, instead of passively mimicking their peers (irrational herding), lenders engage in active observational learning (rational herding); they infer the creditworthiness of borrowers by observing peer lending decisions and use publicly observable borrower characteristics to moderate their inferences. Counterintuitively, obvious defects (e.g., poor credit grades) amplify a listing's herding momentum, as lenders infer superior creditworthiness to justify the herd. Similarly, favorable borrower characteristics (e.g., friend endorsements) weaken the herding effect, as lenders attribute herding to these observable merits. Follow-up analysis shows that rational herding beats irrational herding in predicting loan performance.

We propose a method that jointly estimates the graphical models corresponding to the different categories present in the data, aiming to preserve the common structure, while allowing for differences between the categories. This is achieved through a hierarchical penalty that targets the removal of common zeros in the inverse covariance matrices across categories. We establish the asymptotic consistency and sparsity of the proposed estimator in the high-dimensional case, and illustrate its performance on a number of simulated networks.

From the perspective of fintech develop­ ment, this paper tries to construct a comprehensive index to evaluate the green growth of regional economy based on the in-depth analysis of the influence mechanism of green finance on green growth. At the same time, China’s provincial panel data from 2011 to 2018 are selected to test the impact of fintech innovation and green finance on green growth, and its mechanism. It turns out that fintech and green finance significantly promotes green economic growth. At the same time, the impact of fintech and green finance on green growth has obvious regional heterogeneity, that is, the impact in eastern China is significantly stronger than that in central and western China. Further research shows that fintech innovation mainly promotes green economic growth through green credit and green investment. Therefore, fintech innovation can promote green economic growth by improving the development level of green finance, which has great reference significance for most countries.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a significant increase in malware attacks and malicious traffic. Consequently, several machine learning-based detection models have been developed to detect them. However, the detection accuracy of these models is currently evaluated using different methodologies and datasets, with some studies overstating high detection rates. The lack of a common testing approach coupled with the limited datasets used for the experiments make it challenging to compare the performances of these models to identify those that provide superior detection accuracy. A few studies have focused on benign samples and their effects on detection accuracy. The datasets used in the experiments generally consist of benign and malicious samples; hence, binary classification is used in the machine learning models. In the binary classification task, the size of a benign sample affects the classification accuracy of malicious samples, that is, it can either improve or degrade detection accuracy. In this study, we propose a novel metric for evaluating accuracy degradation by increasing benign sample size. We mainly used the FFRI dataset, which consists of 11,243 malware samples and 250,000 benign samples, and evaluated the classification accuracy with extracted strings from the malware. In addition, we obtained other malware samples that we used as supplementary to the main dataset. We increased the number of benign samples for testing by tenfold, while maintaining the malicious sample and benign training sample sizes, which resulted in a decrease of 0.293 in the F1 score. Furthermore, we confirmed that using a sufficiently sized benign training sample set mitigates accuracy degradation. Our metric can be beneficial for evaluating the benign sample size needed in binary classification and comparing accuracy.},

The analysis results indicate that Japanese major banks, large regional banks, and J-REITs play a key role in terms of degree centrality. In addition, the test results show that no JREIT’s default causes default contagion of the lending institutions based on syndicated loans outstanding at the end of 2021. Overall, this study provides eﬀective methodologies to evaluate the interconnectedness between loans as well as risk contagion from borrowers to lenders in a two-mode network for syndicated loans.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the mechanism how the platform obtains and uses undisclosed information to determine individual borrowers’ credit score and to examine the effectiveness of credit scoring in predicting default. The motivation stems from the fact that there is little evidence about the role of P2P platform, which has been positioned as a kind of information intermediary. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 5,176 unsecured P2P loans having expired before December 31, 2015 on Renrendai.com and an approach of two-stage regression, the paper first estimates the undisclosed information embedded in credit score by regressing credit score on four types of public information about a borrower’s creditworthiness. Then, the authors use a Logit regression to examine the role of the excess information in predicting the default probability. Findings: The certification information provided by the platform is the most important determinant for a borrower’s credit score and the undisclosed information embedded in credit score can predict the loan performance better than the public information of posted listings. Moreover, the predictive ability of the undisclosed information is better for high-risk borrowers than for low-risk ones. Research limitations/implications: Providing a credit score for each individual is a way for P2P platforms to play an information intermediary role. More evidence about whether or how a platform plays its role are worthy to be exploited by investigating a platform’s operating policies in detail and doing cross-platform comparative studies. Practical implications: The results about the effect of various types of information on loan performance can provide an insightful guidance for P2P platforms to optimize their mechanism on information disclosure and credit scoring. Originality/value: The existing literature mainly focuses on the effects of information voluntarily disclosed by borrowers and the behaviors of investors on P2P lending outcomes. The paper highlights the information intermediary role played by the platform and presents empirical evidence that credit scoring for individual borrowers is a way for P2P platforms to promote the direct lending for individual. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Traditional credit markets have been criticized as inefficient in allocating credits to borrowers. Powered by advanced Internet technology, online Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending has emerged as an attractive alternative, especially for small borrowers who have limited assets and are in need of funds urgently. Although several empirical studies have examined factors influencing the micro-level lending outcome, there is a lack of understanding on the overall business model of P2P lending, especially its screening mechanism, and how it helps address the deficiency of the traditional credit market. This paper fills this void. First, we develop a theoretical model incorporating two unique features of P2P lending (soft information and social collateral) and show that in P2P, low-risk borrowers could force high-risk ones off the market under very general conditions. As a result, P2P complements traditional credit markets by serving the unserved (low-risk borrowers with little assets) in the traditional credit markets. Second, we further identify the critical operational settings for P2P success, and the impacts of these settings on borrowers’ welfare. Overall, our model and analyses not only contribute to the literature by showing analytically that P2P and the traditional credit markets are complementary, but also provide practical guidance to P2P platform managers regarding their platform design to help reshape business strategies and enhance business opportunities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {As a new e-commerce phenomenon in financing, peer to peer (P2P) lending has received increased attention recently. For P2P lending platforms, risk control ability (i.e., the ability to accurately assess and screen borrowers to control the credit risk of loans) is a competitive differentiator. The paper models a three-stage game to investigate optimal risk control ability and corresponding optimal prices of P2P lending platforms under different tariffs and agents’ homing choices. Risk-price coefficients for lenders and borrowers are introduced to measure the impact of risk control ability on prices, where higher risk-price coefficients indicate that prices are more sensitive to risk control ability. Moreover, the paper investigates the role of platforms’ scales in deciding optimal risk control ability, prices and market shares. To our best knowledge, this is the first theoretical paper to study the competition in P2P lending considering risk control ability based on game theory. The analytical results show that: 1) In equilibrium, optimal risk control ability decreases in risk-price coefficients; 2) The risk-price coefficient for lenders contributes less than that for borrowers to optimal risk control ability if some lenders multi-home; 3) Smaller platforms have higher risk control ability, prices and attract more borrowers than larger platforms under specific conditions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

For the segmented market case compared with the benchmark one, we find that, while banks' insolvency risk increases, their illiquidity risk decreases such that their overall risk also decreases. Our results imply that sustainable P2P lending requires an appropriate differentiation of roles between banks and P2P lending platforms-P2P lending platforms operate in the low-credit segment and banks' involvement in P2P lending is restricted-so that the growth of P2P lending is not adverse for bank stability. © 2020 by the authors.},

According to the internal rating method of the New Basel Accord, in addition to the probability of default, loss given default is also one of the important indicators of evaluation credit risks. Proceeding from the perspective of loss given default (LGD), this paper conducts an empirical study on the probability distribution of LGDs of P2P as well as its influencing factors with the transaction data of Lending Club. The results show that: (1) the LGDs of P2P loans presents an obvious unimodal distribution, the peak value is relatively high and tends to concentrate with the decrease of the borrower's credit rating, indicating that the distribution of LGDs of P2P lending is similar to that of unsecured bonds; (2) The total asset of the borrower has no significant impact on LGD, the credit rating and the debt-to-income ratio exert a significant negative impact, while the term and amount of the loan produce a relatively strong positive impact. Therefore, when evaluating the borrower's repayment ability, it is required to pay more attention to its assets structure rather than the size of its total assets. When carrying out risk control for the P2P platform, it is necessary to give priority to the control of default rate. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is a new form of loans. Different from traditional banks, lenders provide loans to borrowers directly through P2P platforms. Since many P2P loans are unsecured personal loans, credit rating of loans is vital to control default risk and improve profit for lenders and platforms. Standard binary classifiers are inappropriate in P2P lending because there are multiple credit classes and misclassification costs vary largely across classes in P2P lending. Though there are a few works that studied cost-sensitive classifiers in P2P lending, none of them have analyzed this issue from the perspective of multi-class classifications and measured misclassification costs of different credit grades using real losses and opportunity costs. The objective of this paper is to model credit rating in P2P lending as a cost-sensitive multi-class classification problem. We proposed a misclassification cost matrix for P2P credit grading with a set of equations and models to calculate the costs. An experiment using publicly available data from Lending Club was conducted to validate the usefulness of the proposed misclassification cost matrix. The results showed that the cost-sensitive classifiers can significantly reduce the total cost, which is essential for the survival and profitability of P2P platforms. © 2020 The Author(s).

Besides conventional hard information, soft information also enters into the lending decision process. The descriptive loan texts submitted by borrowers have great potential for exploiting useful soft factors, but also pose great challenges due to the semantic sensitivity to context and the complexity of content representation. We propose a novel text mining method for automatically extracting semantic soft factors from descriptive loan texts. The method maps terms to an embedding space, assembles semantically related terms together into semantic cliques, and then defines semantic soft factors corresponding to the semantic cliques. Empirical evaluation shows that the extracted semantic soft factors contributed to significant improvement on credit risk evaluation in terms of both discrimination performance and granting performance.

Design/methodology/approach: The current credit valuation systems are classified into the forward-looking mechanism, which judges the borrowers’ credit levels based on their uploaded information, and the backward-looking mechanism, which judges the borrowers’ credit levels based on their historical repayment performance. Probit models and Tobit models are used to examine the effectiveness of credit evaluation mechanisms. Findings: The results show that only the “hard” information reflecting borrowers’ credit ability can explain the default risk on the platform under the forward-looking credit evaluation mechanism. The backward-looking credit evaluation mechanism (BCEM) based on the repeated borrowings produces both promise-enhancing and “fishing” incentives and thus fails to explain the default risk, and weakens the effectiveness of forward-looking credit indicators in explaining the default risk because it encourages borrowers to invest in forging forward-looking credit indicators. Additional information such as the interest rate and the repayment periods reveals borrowers’ credit and thus can also be used as a predictor of borrowers’ default risk. Practical implications: The findings suggest that current ex ante screening based on the information collected from the borrowers or repeated borrowings is inadequate to control the default risk in P2P lending markets and thus needs be improved. Ex post monitoring and sharing on defaulter’s information should be strengthened to increase the default cost and thus to deter potential bad borrowers.

	abstract = {Chinese P2P lending platforms have an astonishing default rate of 87.2\% based on data available in 2019, which indicates the seriousness of the problem this industry faces. Insufficient regulation has resulted in generation of risky services, such as margin finance in 2015 for stock markets and zero down-payment mortgages in 2016 for real estate buyers. Such services are prone to resulting in dramatic losses to investors with the following potential causes: adverse selection caused by information asymmetry of the P2P platform operators, lack of financial knowledge or expertise of the investors, insufficient regulation on P2P platforms, and changes in policies related to stock and real estate markets. Does “Too Big to Fail” (TBTF) apply to Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms in China? Are platforms with large Transaction Volumes or large Total Loan Size safer? This paper aims at answering such questions and identifies other factors that have led to defaults of such P2P lending platforms. In order to generate a more robust model that covers a wider range of factors, we adopt two approaches: Failure Prediction Model and Decomposition Methods. The reason why we have adopted this approach was that the factors that caused failure of such P2P platforms were very complicated and varied in nature. Failure Prediction Model is mainly based on the disclosed transaction or financial data. However, Decomposition Method aims at identification of sources of problem from different groups of factors, such as internal operations and external business environment. Also, another contribution of our research is that the data sets that we have used are from three different sources, which provide us a more comprehensive picture about the risks faced by such P2P lending firms. This study provides evidence that the bond yield, which reflects the liquidity level of the market, is the major reason for P2P platforms’ failure during the research period. Our results also indicate that apart from the size-related factors one also needs to answer the question - “Were platforms with larger Transaction Volumes and Total Loan Sizes safer?” The style factors like the interest rate and ownership, the timing factors like loan maturity and bond yield, and the selectivity factors like popularity are found to be even more significant. Hopefully, our findings could contribute academically to the existing literature in the credit risk estimation of online P2P lending platforms and provide practical support for development of a more effective risk monitoring system for online P2P lending platforms. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

This is an important issue because in P2P lending individual investors bear the credit risk, instead of financial institutions, which are experts in dealing with this risk. P2P lenders suffer a severe problem of information asymmetry, because they are at a disadvantage facing the borrower. For this reason, P2P lending sites provide potential lenders with information about borrowers and their loan purpose. They also assign a grade to each loan. The empirical study is based on loans' data collected from Lending Club (N = 24,449) from 2008 to 2014 that are first analyzed by using univariate means tests and survival analysis. Factors explaining default are loan purpose, annual income, current housing situation, credit history and indebtedness. Secondly, a logistic regression model is developed to predict defaults. The grade assigned by the P2P lending site is the most predictive factor of default, but the accuracy of the model is improved by adding other information, especially the borrower's debt level. © 2015 Serrano-Cinca et al.

Previous research identified a number of default determining variables but did not distinguish between different loan risk levels. We define four loan risk classes and test the significance of the default determining variables within each loan risk class. Our findings suggest that the significance of most variables depends on the loan risk class. Only a few variables are consistently significant across all risk classes. The debt-to-income ratio, inquiries in the past six months and a loan intended for a small business are positively correlated with the default rate. Annual income and credit card as loan purpose are negatively correlated. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	doi = {10.1155/2019/1902970},
	abstract = {Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending has attracted increasing attention recently. As an emerging micro-finance platform, P2P lending plays roles in removing intermediaries, reducing transaction costs, and increasing the benefits of both borrowers and lenders. However, for the P2P lending investment, there are two major challenges, the deficiency of loans' historical observations about the certain borrower and the ambiguity problem of estimated loans' distribution. In order to solve the difficulties, this paper proposes a data-driven robust model of portfolio optimization with relative entropy constraints based on an "instance-based" credit risk assessment framework. The model exploits a nonparametric kernel approach to estimate P2P loans' expected return and risk under the condition that the historical data of the same borrower is unavailable. Furthermore, we construct a robust mean-variance optimization problem based on relative entropy method for P2P loan investment decision. Using the real-world dataset from a notable P2P lending platform, Prosper, we validate the proposed model. Empirical results reveal that our model provides better investment performances than the existing model. © 2019 Guotai Chi et al.},

	abstract = {It is extremely important for a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending platform to provide their lenders with a reliable model to predict borrowers’ credit risk. This study introduces four different gradient boosting methods to model the credit risk of borrowers in P2P platforms and estimates the performance of models in a more practical scenario. The timeliness of observations and features is fully investigated in modeling. Each observation is associated with two timestamps that guide the splitting of data set for training and testing models, while no timestamp or only one timestamp was used in most previous research. The hyperparameters of gradient boosting models are optimized by the Bayesian approach, and the models are evaluated in different scenarios. The importance of features implied by gradient boosting models is examined as well. The empirical result shows that the models’ performance from k−fold cross validation is overestimated in comparison to that from rolling windows guided by two timestamps of observations, which indicates that the timestamps plays a significant impact on evaluating the performance of credit risk models in P2P lending. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

This study was based on the elaboration likelihood model and examines how to persuade investors to develop initial trust in P2P platform. The empirical analysis data were collected from 70 Chinese P2P platforms. The multiple linear regression results support central route variables: the financial and credit status of P2P platforms are key elements in building the trust of investors and impacting their decisions. The subordinate route variables including social capital, risk management, and operating duration provide the necessary support to increase the number of platform investors. The relationship between the average interest rate and number of investors is not linear but exhibits an inverted U-shaped curve. The disclosure of information by the borrowers does not significantly affect the number of platform investors.

	abstract = {Text-related soft information effectively alleviates the information asymmetry associated with P2P lending and reduces credit risk. Most existing studies use nonsemantic text information to construct credit evaluation models and predict the borrower's level of risk. However, the semantic information also reflect the ability and willingness of borrowers to repay and might be able to explain borrowers’ credit statuses. This paper examines whether semantic loan description text information helps predict the credit risk of different types of borrowers using a Chinese P2P platform. We use the 5P credit evaluation theory and the word embedding model to extract the semantic features of loan descriptions across five dimensions. Then, the AdaBoost ensemble learning strategy is applied to construct a credit evaluation model to improve the learning performance of an intelligent algorithm. The extracted semantic features are integrated into the evaluation model to study their explanatory ability with regard to the credit status of different types of borrowers. We conducted empirical research on the Renrendai P2P platform. Our conclusions show that the semantic features of textual soft information significantly improve the predictability of credit evaluation models and that the promotion effect is most significant for first-time borrowers.

	abstract = {In the credit market, assessment of a borrower's default risk over time is essential to enabling timely risk management, since borrowers’ exposure to risk and the losses that result from defaults are strongly related to the time when they default. Mixture cure models, with their ability to predict not only whether borrowers will default but also when they are likely to default, have been applied to credit scoring. We propose a prediction-driven mixture cure model, which sacrifices interpretability for potentially better prediction performance, and apply it to credit scoring. In the incidence part of the mixture cure model, we substitute the typical statistical incidence model (i.e., logistic regression) with a more flexible, and hopefully more accurate, classification method (i.e., random forests). For the latency part, we propose a survival analysis model, named Time-Dependent Hazards, which accommodates a direct relationship between failure times and covariates and can potentially better predict the probability of default over time than the standard Cox PH model.

However, neural network learning performed by algorithms such as back-propagation (BP) are known to be slow due to the size of the search space involved and also the iterative manner in which the algorithm works. In this paper, we show that the degree of difficulty in neural network learning is inherent in the given set of training examples. We propose a technique for measuring such learning difficulty, and then develop a feature construction methodology that helps transform the training data so that both the learning speed and classification accuracy of neural network algorithms are improved. We show the efficacy of the proposed method for financial risk classification, a domain characterized by frequent data noise, lack of functional structure, and high attribute interactions. Moreover, the empirical studies also provide insights into the structural characteristics of neural networks with respect to the input data used as well as possible mechanisms to improve the learning performance.},

Systemic risk within the northern euro area banking system is less apparent, while the southern euro area banking system is more prone and susceptible to bank failures provoked by financial contagion.

	abstract = {Financial markets are exposed to systemic risk (SR), the risk that a major fraction of the system ceases to function, and collapses. It has recently become possible to quantify SR in terms of underlying financial networks where nodes represent financial institutions, and links capture the size and maturity of assets (loans), liabilities and other obligations, such as derivatives. We demonstrate that it is possible to quantify the share of SR that individual liabilities within a financial network contribute to the overall SR. We use empirical data of nationwide interbank liabilities to show that the marginal contribution to overall SR of liabilities for a given size varies by a factor of a thousand. We propose a tax on individual transactions that is proportional to their marginal contribution to overall SR. If a transaction does not increase SR, it is tax-free. With an agent-based model (ABM) (CRISIS macro-financial model), we demonstrate that the proposed ‘Systemic Risk Tax’ (SRT) leads to a self-organized restructuring of financial networks that are practically free of SR. The SRT can be seen as an insurance for the public against costs arising from cascading failure. ABM predictions are shown to be in remarkable agreement with the empirical data and can be used to understand the relation of credit risk and SR. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The importance of adequately modeling credit risk has once again been highlighted in the recent financial crisis. Defaults tend to cluster around times of economic stress due to poor macro-economic conditions, but also by directly triggering each other through contagion. Although credit default swaps have radically altered the dynamics of contagion for more than a decade, models quantifying their impact on systemic risk are still missing. Here, we examine contagion through credit default swaps in a stylized economic network of corporates and financial institutions. We analyse such a system using a stochastic setting, which allows us to exploit limit theorems to exactly solve the contagion dynamics for the entire system. Our analysis shows that, by creating additional contagion channels, CDS can actually lead to greater instability of the entire network in times of economic stress. This is particularly pronounced when CDS are used by banks to expand their loan books (arguing that CDS would offload the additional risks from their balance sheets). Thus, even with complete hedging through CDS, a significant loan book expansion can lead to considerably enhanced probabilities for the occurrence of very large losses and very high default rates in the system. Our approach adds a new dimension to research on credit contagion, and could feed into a rational underpinning of an improved regulatory framework for credit derivatives. © EDP Sciences, Società Italiana di Fisica, Springer-Verlag 2012.},

	doi = {10.1057/jors.2008.164},
	abstract = {The introduction of the Basel II Capital Accord has encouraged financial institutions to build internal rating systems assessing the credit risk of their various credit portfolios. One of the key outputs of an internal rating system is the probability of default (PD), which reflects the likelihood that a counterparty will default on his/her financial obligation. Since the PD modelling problem basically boils down to a discrimination problem (defaulter or not), one may rely on the myriad of classification techniques that have been suggested in the literature. However, since the credit risk models will be subject to supervisory review and evaluation, they must be easy to understand and transparent. Hence, techniques such as neural networks or support vector machines are less suitable due to their black box nature. Building upon previous research, we will use AntMiner to build internal rating systems for credit risk. AntMiner allows to infer a propositional rule set from a given data set, hereby using the principles from Ant Colony Optimization. Experiments will be conducted using various types of credit data sets (retail, small- and medium-sized enterprises and banks). It will be shown that the extracted rule sets are both powerful in terms of discriminatory power and comprehensibility. Furthermore, a framework will be presented describing how AntMiner fits into a global Basel II credit risk management system. © 2010 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The design of consistent classifiers to forecast credit-granting choices is critical for many financial decision-making practices. Although a number of artificial and statistical techniques have been developed to predict customer insolvency, how to provide an inclusive appraisal of prediction models and recommend adequate classifiers is still an imperative and understudied area in credit default prediction (CDP) modeling. Previous evidence demonstrates that the ranking of classifiers varies for different criteria with measures under different circumstances. In this study, we address this methodological flaw by proposing the simultaneous application of support vector machine and probabilistic neural network (PNN)-based CDP algorithms, together with frequently used high-performance models. We fill the gap by introducing a set of multidimensional evaluation measures combined with some novel metrics that are helpful in discovering unseen features of the model’s performance. For effectiveness and feasibility purposes, six real-world credit data sets have been applied. Our empirical study shows that the PNN model is more robust than its rivals, and traditional performance evaluations are more or less consistent with their original counterparts. With these contributions, therefore, our investigations offer several advantages to practitioners of financial risk management. © 2018 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.},

	abstract = {A composite model of neural network and rough sets components was constructed to predict a sample of bank holding patterns. The final model was able to correctly classify 96\% of a testing set of four types of bank holding structures. Holding structure is defined as the number of banks under common ownership. For this study, forms of bank holding structure include: banks that are not owned by another company, single banks that are held by another firm, pairs of banks that are held by another enterprise, and three or more banks that are held by another company. Initially, input to the neural network model was 28 financial ratios for more than 200 banks in Arkansas for 1992. The 28 ratios are organized by categories such as liquidity, credit risk, leverage, efficiency, and profitability. The ratios were constructed with 70 bank variables such as net worth, deposits, total assets, net loans, total operating income, etc. The first neural network model correctly classified 84\% of the testing set at a tolerance level of 0.20. Another artificial intelligence (AI) procedure known as two-dimensional rough sets was then applied to the dataset. Rough sets reduced the number of input variables from 28 to 18, a drop of 36\% in the number of input variables. This version of rough sets also eliminated a number of records, thereby reducing the information system (i.e., matrix) on both vertical and horizontal dimensions. A second neural network was trained with the reduced number of input variables and records. This network correctly classified 96\% of the testing set at a tolerance level of 0.20, an increase of 11\% in the accuracy of the prediction. By applying two-dimensional reducts to the dataset of financial ratios, the predictive accuracy of the neural network model was improved substantially. Banking institutions that are prime candidates for mergers or acquisitions can then be more accurately identified through the use of this hybrid decision support system (DSS) which combines different types of AI techniques for the purposes of data management and modeling. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

For example, while initial topological measures showed that the rail network is almost fully connected, dynamical measures highlighted hub nodes that experience disproportionately large traffic. The dynamical assortativity of the bus networks also differed from its topological counterpart. In addition, inspection of the weighted eigenvector centralities highlighted a significant difference in traffic flows for both networks during weekdays and weekends, suggesting the importance of adding a temporal perspective missing from many previous studies. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

	volume = {78},
	doi = {10.1016/j.jnca.2016.10.018},
	abstract = {Betweenness is a measure of the centrality of a node in a network, and is normally calculated as the fraction of shortest paths, random walk paths or flow units between node pairs that pass through the node of interest. Betweenness is, in some sense, a measure of the influence a node possesses over the spread of information in the network. However, the traditional betweenness is based on the information dissemination from one node to another. This is conceptually not suitable for the epidemics in which information is disseminated from one node to multiple neighboring nodes and destinations. To address this problem, we propose a novel betweenness measure based on epidemics. The epidemic betweenness counts the average number of the following nodes influenced by the node of interest after it becomes the epidemic source or an intermediary. This measure reflects the potential influence of a node to any epidemic in complex networks. To justify this measure, we introduce real complex networks and estimate the average influential scale of each node in epidemics through a large number of simulations. We compare the simulation results to those of the epidemic betweenness and another seven classic measures, such as Eigenvector and Katz. We further provide correlation studies to expose the differences of the epidemic betweenness in capturing influential nodes. We find that the epidemic betweenness is exclusively the measure that accurately present the potential influence of each node in epidemics. Finally, as an example of application, the epidemic betweenness measure explains the finding in recent research that unpopular users (nodes with small degree) could also lead to large cascades of epidemics. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Open ontology learning is the process of extracting a domain ontology from a knowledge source in an unsupervised way. Due to its unsupervised nature, it requires filtering mechanisms to rate the importance and correctness of the extracted knowledge. This paper presents OntoCmaps, a domain-independent and open ontology learning tool that extracts deep semantic representations from corpora. OntoCmaps generates rich conceptual representations in the form of concept maps and proposes an innovative filtering mechanism based on metrics from graph theory. Our results show that using metrics such as Betweenness, PageRank, Hits and Degree centrality outperforms the results of standard text-based metrics (TF-IDF, term frequency) for concept identification. We propose voting schemes based on these metrics that provide a good performance in relationship identification, which again provides better results (in terms of precision and F-measure) than other traditional metrics such as frequency of co-occurrences. The approach is evaluated against a gold standard and is compared to the ontology learning tool Text2Onto.

	abstract = {Starting with the premise that subteam psychological safety (PS) microclimates are vitally important to team behavior yet invisible to team-level PS concepts and measures, we introduce a multilevel theory and model of PS within work teams. We first demonstrate the inevitability and influence of distinct PS microclimates in teams and highlight the limits of current team PS approaches, and then develop a multilevel PS theory using social network methods. We introduce multilevel PS measures and theorize their influence on specific aspects of team and subteam learning and performance outcomes. These include new applications of traditional network metrics (e.g., team PS density, member-only PS density, subteam PS density, and leader PS centrality) and a newly developed multilevel team PS index (mPSi). The mPSi measure synthesizes multilevel leader and member PS influences in a single number to better predict outcomes in teams that engage in multilevel (subteam and intact-team) activity to meet work demands. We employ the new metrics to examine four archetypal team PS structures, contrasting new and current approaches and illuminating the implications of incongruity between subteam and intact-team safety climates. We propose that this multilevel theory extends the team PS literature, effecting far greater understanding and prediction of team outcomes and development, while increasing the number of team PS studies that reach publication. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.},

	doi = {10.1109/TKDE.2013.25},
	abstract = {High-dimensional data arise naturally in many domains, and have regularly presented a great challenge for traditional data mining techniques, both in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Clustering becomes difficult due to the increasing sparsity of such data, as well as the increasing difficulty in distinguishing distances between data points. In this paper, we take a novel perspective on the problem of clustering high-dimensional data. Instead of attempting to avoid the curse of dimensionality by observing a lower dimensional feature subspace, we embrace dimensionality by taking advantage of inherently high-dimensional phenomena. More specifically, we show that hubness, i.e., the tendency of high-dimensional data to contain points (hubs) that frequently occur in (k)-nearest-neighbor lists of other points, can be successfully exploited in clustering. We validate our hypothesis by demonstrating that hubness is a good measure of point centrality within a high-dimensional data cluster, and by proposing several hubness-based clustering algorithms, showing that major hubs can be used effectively as cluster prototypes or as guides during the search for centroid-based cluster configurations. Experimental results demonstrate good performance of our algorithms in multiple settings, particularly in the presence of large quantities of noise. The proposed methods are tailored mostly for detecting approximately hyperspherical clusters and need to be extended to properly handle clusters of arbitrary shapes. © 1989-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose - The paper aims to examine structural positions of individuals, especially HR actors (line managers and HR specialists) within relational networks for creating and sharing knowledge and to explore implications for designing and implementing HR practices in knowledge-intensive firms (KIF). Design/methodology/approach - This article used exploratory research design conducting a single case study of a KIF. Social network analysis (SNA) - network centrality measures and visualization tools - was used to examine the structural position of individuals. Findings - Line managers who are HR actors are centrally positioned within examined knowledge networks, while the HR specialist is not, which implies that the decentralized approach to HRM in KIF can be effective. Results also show that the more operational (instrumental) the information or knowledge flow is, the denser the knowledge networks. Research limitations/implications - This study provides support for devolution of HRM to the line in KIF. It suggests that HRM could affect the process of knowledge creation and sharing by implementing HR practices through centrally positioned line managers. A limitation of the research is a single case study and observed intensity rather than quality of relations. Practical implications - SNA appears to be an effective tool for mapping relationships in an organization. Centrally positioned HR actors (especially line managers involved in HRM) in knowledge networks are advantageous for HRM effectiveness only if obstacles to their effectiveness are properly managed. HR specialists should relate strongly to these actors to enable successful design and implementation of HR practices. Originality/value - The paper applies SNA to the HRM field, thus expanding the traditional view of HRM into examining the position of HR actors in relational networks and exploring their role in effectively executing HR practices. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

As the first step towards this objective, we introduce an umbrella framework for defining and characterizing an ensemble of dynamic processes on a network. This framework generalizes the traditional Laplacian framework to continuous-time biased random walks and also allows us to model some epidemic processes over a network. For each dynamic process in our framework, we can define a function that measures the quality of every subset of nodes as a potential cluster (or community) with respect to this process on a given network. This subset-quality function generalizes the traditional conductance measure for graph partitioning. We partially justify our choice of the quality function by showing that the classic Cheeger's inequality, which relates the conductance of the best cluster in a network with a spectral quantity of its Laplacian matrix, can be extended from the Laplacian-conductance setting to this more general setting. © 2014 ACM.},

In addition, we discuss how to decide the traffic sampling rates at the selected switches.

The proposed method determines the influence of a node based on its local location and global location. It considers both the local and global structure of the network. Traditional degree centrality is improved and combined with the notion of the local clustering coefficient to measure the local influence of nodes, and the classical k-shell decomposition method is improved to measure the global influence of nodes. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model is utilized to examine the spreading capability of nodes. A number of experiments are conducted on 11 real-world networks to compare the proposed method with other methods.

	doi = {10.1103/PhysRevE.85.066103},
	abstract = {Here we present a range-limited approach to centrality measures in both nonweighted and weighted directed complex networks. We introduce an efficient method that generates for every node and every edge its betweenness centrality based on shortest paths of lengths not longer than =1,...,L in the case of nonweighted networks, and for weighted networks the corresponding quantities based on minimum weight paths with path weights not larger than w=Δ, =1,2...,L=R/Δ. These measures provide a systematic description on the positioning importance of a node (edge) with respect to its network neighborhoods one step out, two steps out, etc., up to and including the whole network. They are more informative than traditional centrality measures, as network transport typically happens on all length scales, from transport to nearest neighbors to the farthest reaches of the network. We show that range-limited centralities obey universal scaling laws for large nonweighted networks. As the computation of traditional centrality measures is costly, this scaling behavior can be exploited to efficiently estimate centralities of nodes and edges for all ranges, including the traditional ones. The scaling behavior can also be exploited to show that the ranking top list of nodes (edges) based on their range-limited centralities quickly freezes as a function of the range, and hence the diameter-range top list can be efficiently predicted. We also show how to estimate the typical largest node-to-node distance for a network of N nodes, exploiting the afore-mentioned scaling behavior. These observations were made on model networks and on a large social network inferred from cell-phone trace logs (∼5.5×106 nodes and ∼2.7×107 edges). Finally, we apply these concepts to efficiently detect the vulnerability backbone of a network (defined as the smallest percolating cluster of the highest betweenness nodes and edges) and illustrate the importance of weight-based centrality measures in weighted networks in detecting such backbones. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {Essential proteins are indispensable to cellular life. Identification of essential proteins plays a critical role in the survival and development of life process and understanding the function of cell machinery. The experimental methods are usually costly and time-consuming, in order to overcome these limitations, many computational methods have been proposed to discover essential proteins based on the topological features of PPI networks and other biological information. In this paper, a novel method named RSG is proposed to predict essential proteins based on RNA-Seq, subcellular localization and GO annotation datasets. First, the experiments show that the RNA-Seq data is more advantageous than traditional gene expression data in predicting essential proteins, meanwhile, the protein essentiality is closely related to the subcellular localization information and protein GO terms through data analysis. A new weighted PPI network is constructed, which integrates the GO terms information with Pearson correlation coefficient of RNA-Seq data. Then, the weighted edge clustering coefficient is developed to measure the connectivity of protein nodes. RSG determines the essentiality based on not only the subcellular localization information but also the co-expressed level and functional similarity characterized by RNA-Seq and GO annotation data. The experimental results on two species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster), the performance of RSG was compared with other centrality methods, the results show that RSG has a better performance in predicting essential proteins. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {We apply percolation theory to a recently proposed measure of fragmentation F for social networks. The measure F is defined as the ratio between the number of pairs of nodes that are not connected in the fragmented network after removing a fraction q of nodes and the total number of pairs in the original fully connected network. We compare F with the traditional measure used in percolation theory, P, the fraction of nodes in the largest cluster relative to the total number of nodes. Using both analytical and numerical methods from percolation, we study Erdos-Rényi and scale-free networks under various types of node removal strategies. The removal strategies are random removal, high degree removal, and high betweenness centrality removal. We find that for a network obtained after removal (all strategies) of a fraction q of nodes above percolation threshold, P (1-F)12. For fixed P and close to percolation threshold (q= qc), we show that 1-F better reflects the actual fragmentation. Close to qc, for a given P, 1-F has a broad distribution and it is thus possible to improve the fragmentation of the network. We also study and compare the fragmentation measure F and the percolation measure P for a real social network of workplaces linked by the households of the employees and find similar results. © 2007 The American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {Individuals suffering from autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit impaired social communication, the manifestations of which include abnormal eye contact and gaze. In this study, we first seek to characterize the spatial and temporal attributes of this atypical eye gaze. To achieve that goal, we analyze and compare eye-tracking data of ASD and typical development (TD) children. A fixation time analysis indicates that ASD children exhibit a distinct gaze pattern when looking at faces, spending significantly more time at the mouth and less at the eyes, compared with TD children. Another goal of this study is to identify an analytic approach that can better reveal differences between the face scanning patterns of ASD and TD children. Face scanning involves transitioning from one area of interest (AOI) to another and is not taken into account by the traditional fixation time analysis. Instead, we apply four network analysis approaches that measure the “importance” of a given AOI: degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. Degree centrality and eignevector centrality yield statistically significant difference in the mouth and right eye, respectively, between the ASD and TD groups, whereas betweenness centrality reveals statistically significant between-group differences in four AOIs. Closeness centrality yields statistically meaningful differences in three AOIs, but those differences are negligible. Thus, our results suggest that betweenness centrality is the most effective network analysis approach in distinguishing the eye gaze patterns between ASD and TD children. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The spatial distribution of tourists is uneven and it can include some areas at regional and/or sub-regional level. The social-economic and environmental impacts of tourism, are concentrated in different areas. Some recent contributions show the usefulness and the effectiveness of network analysis (NA) approach in revising the organization of tourist facilities and services. This paper proposes to apply methods borrowed from NA to map the spatial distribution of tourism mobility in Sicily. So, we analyze the network features of tourism in a multi-destinations net. By means of traditional measures of NA, we propose to measure the links among destinations. The study aims to connect destinations, represented as nodes, to define a territorial network of tourism demand. In the specific instance, the degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality are used to localize central areas and the main routes. We test survey data collected on a sample of tourists leaving from airports and ports of the main Sicilian cities, who visited two destinations at least. Then, we study tourism mobility on those areas selected by tourists. Finally, employing measures derived from NA, the work attempts to set out territorial networks. This approach could be useful to plane tourism development policies. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Much of the past work in network analysis has focused on analyzing discrete graphs, where binary edges represent the “presence” or “absence” of a relationship. Since traditional network measures (e.g., betweenness centrality) assume a discrete link structure, data about complex systems must be transformed to this representation before calculating network properties. In many domains where there may be uncertainty about the relationship structure, this transformation to a discrete representation will result in a lose of information. In order to represent and reason with network uncertainty, we move beyond the discrete graph framework and develop social network measures based on a probabilistic graph representation. More specifically, we develop measures of path length, betweenness centrality, and clustering coefficient—one set based on sampling and one based on probabilistic paths. We evaluate our methods on two real-world networks, Enron and Facebook, showing that our proposed methods more accurately capture salient effects without being susceptible to local noise.

	abstract = {Centrality is one of the most studied concepts in social network analysis. There is a huge literature regarding centrality measures, as ways to identify the most relevant users in a social network. The challenge is to find measures that can be computed efficiently, and that can be able to classify the users according to relevance criteria as close as possible to reality. We address this problem in the context of the Twitter network, an online social networking service with millions of users and an impressive flow of messages that are published and spread daily by interactions between users. Twitter has different types of users, but the greatest utility lies in finding the most influential ones. The purpose of this article is to collect and classify the different Twitter influence measures that exist so far in literature. These measures are very diverse. Some are based on simple metrics provided by the Twitter API, while others are based on complex mathematical models. Several measures are based on the PageRank algorithm, traditionally used to rank the websites on the Internet. Some others consider the timeline of publication, others the content of the messages, some are focused on specific topics, and others try to make predictions. We consider all these aspects, and some additional ones. Furthermore, we include measures of activity and popularity, the traditional mechanisms to correlate measures, and some important aspects of computational complexity for this particular context. © 2016},

	abstract = {Mobile social networks exploit human mobility and consequent device-to-device contact to opportunistically create data paths over time. While links in mobile social networks are time-varied and strongly impacted by human mobility, discovering influential nodes is one of the important issues for efficient information propagation in mobile social networks. Although traditional centrality definitions give metrics to identify the nodes with central positions in static binary networks, they cannot effectively identify the influential nodes for information propagation in mobile social networks. In this paper, we address the problems of discovering the influential nodes in mobile social networks. We first use the temporal evolution graph model which can more accurately capture the topology dynamics of the mobile social network over time. Based on the model, we explore human social relations and mobility patterns to redefine three common centrality metrics: degree centrality, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality. We then employ empirical traces to evaluate the benefits of the proposed centrality metrics, and discuss the predictability of nodes' global centrality ranking by nodes' local centrality ranking. Results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed centrality metrics. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	doi = {10.1145/2063576.2063741},
	abstract = {Link prediction is a fundamental problem in social network analysis. The key technique in unsupervised link prediction is to find an appropriate similarity measure between nodes of a network. A class of wildly used similarity measures are based on random walk on graph. The traditional random walk (TRW) considers the link structures by treating all nodes in a network equivalently, and ignores the centrality of nodes of a network. However, in many real networks, nodes of a network not only prefer to link to the similar node, but also prefer to link to the central nodes of the network. To address this issue, we use maximal entropy random walk (MERW) for link prediction, which incorporates the centrality of nodes of the network. First, we study certain important properties of MERW on graph G by constructing an eigen-weighted graph G. We show that the transition matrix and stationary distribution of MERW on G are identical to the ones of TRW on G. Based on G, we further give the maximal entropy graph Laplacians, and show how to fast compute the hitting time and commute time of MERW. Second, we propose four new graph kernels and two similarity measures based on MERW for link prediction. Finally, to exhibit the power of MERW in link prediction, we compare 27 various link prediction methods over 3 synthetic and 8 real networks. The results show that our newly proposed MERW based methods outperform the state-of-the-art method on most datasets. © 2011 ACM.},

	abstract = {Link prediction in social networks has attracted increasing attention in various fields such as sociology, anthropology, information science, and computer science. Most existing methods adopt a static graph representation to predict new links. However, these methods lose some important topological information of dynamic networks. In this work, we present a method for link prediction in dynamic networks by integrating temporal information, community structure, and node centrality in the network. Information on all of these aspects is highly beneficial in predicting potential links in social networks. Temporal information offers link occurrence behavior in the dynamic network, while community clustering shows how strong the connection between two individual nodes is, based on whether they share the same community. The centrality of a node, which measures its relative importance within a network, is highly related with future links in social networks. We predict a node’s future importance by eigenvector centrality, and use this for link prediction. Merging the typological information, including community structure and centrality, with temporal information generates a more realistic model for link prediction in dynamic networks. Experimental results on real datasets show that our method based on the integrated time model can predict future links efficiently in temporal social networks, and achieves higher quality results than traditional methods. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {The popularity of social networks has grown manifolds in recent years because of various activities like fast propagation of ideas, publicity, and news. Influence maximization (IM) is one of the most highly studied problems in the field of social network analysis due to its business values. Influence maximization aims to identify influential nodes that can spread the information to the maximum number of nodes in the network through diffusion cascade. Traditional methods for IM include centrality based and greedy based measures. However, each method has some limitations. Recently, some methods of IM are introduced, which consider the presence of community structure in networks. Community structure has a significant impact on information diffusion, because of dense connections between the nodes in the community. In this paper, we propose a novel influence maximization algorithm using node seeding, label propagation, and community detection. We first use extended h-index centrality to detect the seed nodes and then use the label propagation technique to detect communities. Further, we merge smaller and related communities to a larger community with the help of a relationship matrix. Finally, top-k influential nodes from these communities are identified. These ideas lead to our proposed algorithm: Influence Maximization using Extended h-index, and Label Propagation with Relationship matrix (IM-ELPR). We adopt Independent Cascade (IC) information diffusion model to spread the information originating from chosen influential nodes. The proposed algorithm intends to identify influential nodes from different communities globally and does not depend on the specific community’s antecedent structural information. Experimental results performed on several real-life data sets reveal that the proposed algorithm performs better than many other existing popular algorithms. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.},

However, analysis of the literature both at the macro level and micro level will allow for better recognizing the AD research field. Therefore, in this study we adopt a more comprehensive approach to analyze the AD literature, which consists of productivity analysis (year, journal/proceeding, author, and Medical Subject Heading terms), network analysis (co-occurrence frequency, centrality, and community) and content analysis. To this end, we collect metadata of 96,081 articles retrieved from PubMed. We specifically perform the concept graph-based network analysis applying the five centrality measures after mapping the semantic relationship between the UMLS concepts from the AD literature. We also analyze the time-series topical trend using the Dirichlet multinomial regression topic modeling technique. The results indicate that the year 2013 is the most productive year and Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease the most productive journal.

Then we investigate their social influence using network centrality metrics. The experiments show that top influencers with high academic impact tend to be senior scholars with many coauthors.

	abstract = {How to identify critical nodes in metro networks is still an open and vital topic in complex networks, which has been a key issue in analyzing the structural organization of a network, especially in public transportation. Many effective measures have been developed to solve this problem in undirected or unweighted network. However, statistical indicators of static networks cannot reflect the spatial–temporal characteristics of passenger flow in the metro network. Furthermore, a single measure in critical nodes identification has its own shortcomings causing inaccurate estimation results. In this paper, a novel method for node significance on metro network based on Improved Topological Potential model considering Entropy (ITPE) is proposed. ITPE is utilized to aggregate the multi-measure by considering several different centrality measures to conduct the evaluation of node importance. In order to fully reflect the influence of nodes, topological entropy is adopted and applied to identify the weights of different centrality measures. In addition, invulnerability measurement is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed node identification method. Finally, the metro transit system in Shenzhen City, China was used as a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. It is found that ITPE method could effectively identify nodes or stations which are crucial both on network structure and passenger flow mobility while traditional undirected and unweighted network cannot completely identify. Accordingly, all the nodes estimated from ITPE method are ranked by the significance, and invulnerability is further used to test the rationality of the identification for critical nodes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Some recent researches have shown that community structure, which is a common and important topological property of social networks, has significant effect on the dynamics of networks.

In the traditional social network and its routing algorithm, there are only a few fixed source nodes and transmission mode.

In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes an effective data transmission scheme in opportunistic social networks, that is, A source node Centrality and community Restructuring based Hybrid Routing (CRHR) algorithm. The algorithm consists of two parts. In the first part, we measure the centrality of the source node by calculating the critical path where the node is located, and iterate to get the optimal source node and its corresponding relay node. In the second part, we will expand the Opportunity Social Network and rebuild the extended community with the Steiner Minimum Tree to minimize the cost of community data transmission. The simulation results show that the algorithm has lower data transmission delay and cost than other algorithms, and can significantly improve the data transmission rate and efficiency. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

These existing measures suggest specific attribute of an actor (i.e., popularity, accessibility, and brokerage behavior). In this study, we propose new hybrid centrality measures (i.e., Degree-Degree, Degree-Closeness and Degree-Betweenness), by combining existing measures (i.e., degree, closeness and betweenness) with a proposition to better understand the importance of actors in a given network. Generalized set of measures are also proposed for weighted networks. Our analysis of co-authorship networks dataset suggests significant correlation of our proposed new centrality measures (especially weighted networks) than traditional centrality measures with performance of the scholars.

	abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) consist of a large number of spatially distributed sensor nodes connected through the wireless medium to monitor and record the physical information from the environment. The nodes of WSN are battery powered, so after a certain period it loose entire energy. This energy constraint affects the lifetime of the network. The objective of this study is to minimize the overall energy consumption and to maximize the network lifetime. At present, clustering and routing algorithms are widely used in WSNs to enhance the network lifetime. In this study, the Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA) is employed to choose an optimal cluster head from a group of nodes. The cluster head selection is optimized by the residual energy of the nodes, distance to the neighbors, distance to the base station, node degree and node centrality. The route between the cluster head and the base station is identified by using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), it selects the optimal route based on the distance, residual energy and node degree. The performance measures of this proposed methodology are analyzed in terms of alive nodes, dead nodes, energy consumption and data packets received by the BS. The outputs of the proposed methodology are compared with traditional approaches LEACH, DEEC and compared with some existing methods FUCHAR, CRHS, BERA, CPSO, ALOC and FLION. For example, the alive nodes of the proposed methodology are 200 at 1500 iterations which is higher compared to the CRHS and BERA methods. © 2020},

	volume = {32},
	doi = {10.1002/int.21899},
	abstract = {In this paper, we propose an approach to data analysis, which is based entirely on the empirical observations of discrete data samples and the relative proximity of these points in the data space. At the core of the proposed new approach is the typicality—an empirically derived quantity that resembles probability. This nonparametric measure is a normalized form of the square centrality (centrality is a measure of closeness used in graph theory). It is also closely linked to the cumulative proximity and eccentricity (a measure of the tail of the distributions that is very useful for anomaly detection and analysis of extreme values). In this paper, we introduce and study two types of typicality, namely its local and global versions. The local typicality resembles the well-known probability density function (pdf), probability mass function, and fuzzy set membership but differs from all of them. The global typicality, on the other hand, resembles well-known histograms but also differs from them. A distinctive feature of the proposed new approach, empirical data analysis (EDA), is that it is not limited by restrictive impractical prior assumptions about the data generation model as the traditional probability theory and statistical learning approaches are. Moreover, it does not require an explicit and binary assumption of either randomness or determinism of the empirically observed data, their independence, or even their number (it can be as low as a couple of data samples). The typicality is considered as a fundamental quantity in the pattern analysis, which is derived directly from data and is stated in a discrete form in contrast to the traditional approach where a continuous pdf is assumed a priori and estimated from data afterward. The typicality introduced in this paper is free from the paradoxes of the pdf. Typicality is objectivist while the fuzzy sets and the belief-based branch of the probability theory are subjectivist. The local typicality is expressed in a closed analytical form and can be calculated recursively, thus, computationally very efficiently. The other nonparametric ensemble properties of the data introduced and studied in this paper, namely, the square centrality, cumulative proximity, and eccentricity, can also be updated recursively for various types of distance metrics. Finally, a new type of classifier called naïve typicality-based EDA class is introduced, which is based on the newly introduced global typicality. This is only one of the wide range of possible applications of EDA including but not limited for anomaly detection, clustering, classification, control, prediction, control, rare events analysis, etc., which will be the subject of further research. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Outsourcing data to a third-party administrative control, as is done in cloud computing, gives rise to security concerns. The data compromise may occur due to attacks by other users and nodes within the cloud. Therefore, high security measures are required to protect data within the cloud. However, the employed security strategy must also take into account the optimization of the data retrieval time. In this paper, we propose division and replication of data in the cloud for optimal performance and security (DROPS) that collectively approaches the security and performance issues. In the DROPS methodology, we divide a file into fragments, and replicate the fragmented data over the cloud nodes. Each of the nodes stores only a single fragment of a particular data file that ensures that even in case of a successful attack, no meaningful information is revealed to the attacker. Moreover, the nodes storing the fragments, are separated with certain distance by means of graph T-coloring to prohibit an attacker of guessing the locations of the fragments. Furthermore, the DROPS methodology does not rely on the traditional cryptographic techniques for the data security; thereby relieving the system of computationally expensive methodologies. We show that the probability to locate and compromise all of the nodes storing the fragments of a single file is extremely low. We also compare the performance of the DROPS methodology with 10 other schemes. The higher level of security with slight performance overhead was observed. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The international exchange of goods and services is increasingly organised along global value chains in which the various production stages are carried out at many different locations all over the world. A country can be seen as holding a central position in global trade to the extent that it is involved in a large number of economic transactions with alternative potential suppliers and has a wide access to different important markets. However, the centrality of countries’ positions in the international production of goods and services may vary according to the specific stages of the production process that countries occupy. Here we adopt a network-based perspective, and propose a novel three-faceted measure of centrality that captures countries’ distinct roles at the upstream, midstream, and downstream stages of the international production process. Findings suggest that rankings of countries based on our measures of centrality vary across production stages. While emerging and developing countries tend to secure central positions at upstream and midstream production stages, high-income countries tend to exert prevailing roles at downstream stages. Moreover, rankings based on our measures differ from alternative rankings obtained from traditional measures of market power simply reflecting aggregate trade values. This is especially the case within more traditional industries, such as Textiles and Apparel, in which small and less developed countries can play relevant roles at various stages of the production process. © 2017, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {As engineering firms, R\&D groups, and technical organizations recognize the centrality of their engineers' expertise to their performance, they are widely investing in knowledge management (KM) initiatives. Contemporary KM initiatives increasingly include expertise-sharing networks that help answer questions about who knows what. These systems allow organizations to locate and leverage the specialized engineering and technical expertise that is held in the minds of dispersed individuals. However, stories of such expertise-sharing networks that languish from under-use and abandonment abound and the issue of continuance has received very little attention in prior research. In this paper, we explore this understudied issue. We develop a model of expertise-sharing network system continuance through a four-year observational study of 418 users of two such systems and then empirically test it using multiperiod data collected from 122 users of four such systems. The concept of irretrievable investments was used to guide theoretical development in the initial observational phase of the study. The study makes several unique theoretical contributions. First, it develops a model that illustrates how irretrievable postadoption investments (sunk costs) by individual users of expertise-network systems increase continuance. We empirically show that the model explains approximately half of the total variance in continuance intention. This model advances continuance beyond the traditional expectation-satisfaction model of initial adoption to more advanced postadoption stages of use and theoretically incorporates the network- specificity aspect of postadoption investments in explaining continuance. Specifically, we show that individual users': 1) reputation among peer users of a system increases continuance; 2) system-mediated relationships with other users of the system increase continuance; and 3) investments in personalization of a system initially diminish continuance. Another notable contribution is the development and validation of several new measures for expertise-sharing network constructs. © 2005 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Centrality and influence spread are two of the most studied concepts in social network analysis. In recent years, centrality measures have attracted the attention of many researchers, generating a large and varied number of new studies about social network analysis and its applications. However, as far as we know, traditional models of influence spread have not yet been exhaustively used to define centrality measures according to the influence criteria. Most of the considered work in this topic is based on the independent cascade model. In this paper we explore the possibilities of the linear threshold model for the definition of centrality measures to be used on weighted and labeled social networks. We propose a new centrality measure to rank the users of the network, the Linear Threshold Rank (LTR), and a centralization measure to determine to what extent the entire network has a centralized structure, the Linear Threshold Centralization (LTC). We appraise the viability of the approach through several case studies. We consider four different social networks to compare our new measures with two centrality measures based on relevance criteria and another centrality measure based on the independent cascade model. Our results show that our measures are useful for ranking actors and networks in a distinguishable way. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper we study node centrality for very large graphs, up to billions of nodes and edges. Various definitions for centrality have been proposed, ranging from very simple (e.g., node degree) to more elaborate. However, measuring centrality in billion-scale graphs poses several challenges. Many of the "traditional" definitions such as closeness and betweenness were not designed with scalability in mind. Therefore, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to compute them both accurately and efficiently. In this paper, we propose centrality measures suitable for very large graphs, as well as scalable methods to effectively compute them. More specifically, we propose effective closeness and LINERANK which are designed for billion-scale graphs. We also develop algorithms to compute the proposed centrality measures in MAPREDUCE, a modern paradigm for large-scale, distributed data processing. We present extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets, which demonstrate the scalability of our approach to very large graphs, as well as interesting findings and anomalies.

	abstract = {To date immunity to disruptions of multi-scale urban road networks (URNs) has not been effectively quantified. This study uses robustness as a meaningful - if partial - representation of immunity. We propose a novel Relative Area Index (RAI) based on traffic assignment theory to quantitatively measure the robustness of URNs under global capacity degradation due to three different types of disruptions, which takes into account many realistic characteristics. We also compare the RAI with weighted betweenness centrality, a traditional topological metric of robustness. We employ six realistic URNs as case studies for this comparison. Our analysis shows that RAI is a more effective measure of the robustness of URNs when multi-scale URNs suffer from global disruptions. This improved effectiveness is achieved because of RAI's ability to capture the effects of realistic network characteristics such as network topology, flow patterns, link capacity, and travel demand. Also, the results highlight the importance of central management when URNs suffer from disruptions. Our novel method may provide a benchmark tool for comparing robustness of multi-scale URNs, which facilitates the understanding and improvement of network robustness for the planning and management of URNs.

	abstract = {We provide the first large-scale empirical evidence of banks functioning as tax planning intermediaries. We posit that some banks specialize in assisting corporate clients with tax planning. In this role, banks make use of their centrality in financial relationships; access to private information; and ability to structure, execute, and participate in tax planning transactions for clients. We measure bank-client relationships using loan contracts and measure client tax planning using either the cash effective tax rate or the unrecognized tax benefit balance. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that firms experience meaningful tax reductions when they begin a relationship with a bank whose existing clients engage in above-median tax planning. The effects of pairing with such tax intermediary banks are concentrated in relationships with larger or longer maturity loans, clients with foreign income or greater credit risk, and when the bank is an industry specialist or has above-median investment banking activities. Finally, we find that potential clients are more likely to choose tax intermediary banks than nontax intermediary banks, suggesting that tax intermediary banks benefit by attracting new business. Collectively, our results suggest that some banks act as tax planning intermediaries, a role beyond the traditional one of financial intermediary. © University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2018},

	abstract = {Despite its centrality to human thought and practice, aesthetics has for the most part played a petty role in human-computer interaction research. Increasingly, however, researchers attempt to strike a balance between the traditional concerns of human-computer interaction and considerations of aesthetics. Thus, recent research suggests that the visual aesthetics of computer interfaces is a strong determinant of users' satisfaction and pleasure. However, the lack of appropriate concepts and measures of aesthetics may severely constraint future research in this area. To address this issue, we conducted four studies in order to develop a measurement instrument of perceived web site aesthetics. Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses we found that users' perceptions consists of two main dimensions, which we termed "classical aesthetics" and "expressive aesthetics". The classical aesthetics dimension pertains to aesthetic notions that presided from antiquity until the 18th century. These notions emphasize orderly and clear design and are closely related to many of the design rules advocated by usability experts. The expressive aesthetics dimension is manifested by the designers' creativity and originality and by the ability to break design conventions. While both dimensions of perceived aesthetic are drawn from a pool of aesthetic judgments, they are clearly distinguishable from each other. Each of the aesthetic dimensions is measured by a five-item scale. The reliabilities, factor structure and validity tests indicate that these items reflect the two perceived aesthetics dimensions adequately. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Essential proteins are indispensable for cellular life. It is of great significance to identify essential proteins that can help us understand the minimal requirements for cellular life and is also very important for drug design. However, identification of essential proteins based on experimental approaches are typically time-consuming and expensive. With the development of high-throughput technology in the post-genomic era, more and more protein-protein interaction data can be obtained, which make it possible to study essential proteins from the network level. There have been a series of computational approaches proposed for predicting essential proteins based on network topologies. Most of these topology based essential protein discovery methods were to use network centralities. In this paper, we investigate the essential proteins' topological characters from a completely new perspective. To our knowledge it is the first time that topology potential is used to identify essential proteins from a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The basic idea is that each protein in the network can be viewed as a material particle which creates a potential field around itself and the interaction of all proteins forms a topological field over the network. By defining and computing the value of each protein's topology potential, we can obtain a more precise ranking which reflects the importance of proteins from the PPI network. The experimental results show that topology potential-based methods TP and TP-NC outperform traditional topology measures: degree centrality (DC), betweenness centrality (BC), closeness centrality (CC), subgraph centrality (SC), eigenvector centrality (EC), information centrality (IC), and network centrality (NC) for predicting essential proteins. In addition, these centrality measures are improved on their performance for identifying essential proteins in biological network when controlled by topology potential. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

HEC is a well-suited architecture for human-centered technologies such as mobile crowdsensing (MCS) as it allows conveying and distributing sensing tasks at the edges of the network, also enabling (local) sensing data collection from devices. This article, through the joint use of HEC and MCS paradigms, introduces a new social-driven edge computing architecture based on incentives and centrality measures. The core idea is to add social MEC (SMEC) nodes to complement the traditional edge nodes (i.e., the main actors of the middle layer of the standard MEC architecture), acting as bridges between other devices and the cloud. The principle that underlies the SMEC selection is based on the attitude of the users in performing tasks and on their measures of centrality. In addition, we report extensive experimental results based on co-location traces and cooperativeness scores extracted from the ParticipAct living lab, a well-known MCS dataset based on data collected between 2013 and 2015 from 170 students of the University of Bologna, that show how the selection based on centrality measurements returns greater benefits than simple selection based on cooperativeness scores. © 2019 IEEE.},

Proponents of the altmetrics approach have pointed out that new media allow for new avenues of scientific impact assessment. Traditional impact measures based on bibliographic analysis have long been criticized for overlooking the relational dynamics of scientific impact. We therefore propose an application of social network analysis to researchers' interactions on an academic social networking site to generate potential new metrics of scientific impact. Based on a case study conducted among a sample of Swiss management scholars, we analyze how centrality measures derived from the participants' interactions on the academic SNS ResearchGate relate to traditional, offline impact indicators. We find that platform engagement, seniority, and publication impact contribute to members' indegree and eigenvector centrality on the platform, but less so to closeness or betweenness centrality. We conclude that a relational approach based on social network analyses of academic SNS, while subject to platform-specific dynamics, may add richness and differentiation to scientific impact assessment. © 2015 ASIS\&T.},

	doi = {10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2900520},
	abstract = {The volume of research articles in digital repositories is increasing. This spectacular growth of repositories makes it rather difficult for researchers to obtain related research papers in response to their queries. The problem becomes worse when a researcher with insufficient knowledge of searching research articles uses these repositories. In the traditional recommendation approaches, the results of the query miss many high-quality papers, in the related work section, which are either published recently or have low citation count. To overcome this problem, there needs to be a solution which considers not only structural relationships between the papers but also inspects the quality of authors publishing those articles. Many research paper recommendation approaches have been implemented which includes collaborative filtering-based, content-based, and citation analysis-based techniques. The collaborative filtering-based approaches primarily use paper-citation matrix for recommendations, whereas the content-based approaches only consider the content of the paper. The citation analysis considers the structure of the network and focuses on papers citing or cited by the paper of interest. It is therefore very difficult for a recommender system to recommend high-quality papers without a hybrid approach that incorporates multiple features, such as citation information and author information. The proposed method creates a multilevel citation and relationship network of authors in which the citation network uses the structural relationship between the papers to extract significant papers, and authors' collaboration network finds key authors from those papers. The papers selected by this hybrid approach are then recommended to the user. The results have shown that our proposed method performs exceedingly well as compared with the state-of-the-art existing systems, such as Google scholar and multilevel simultaneous citation network. © 2013 IEEE.},

	volume = {48},
	doi = {10.1109/TCYB.2017.2753880},
	abstract = {Based on a critical analysis of data analytics and its foundations, we propose a functional approach to estimate data ensemble properties, which is based entirely on the empirical observations of discrete data samples and the relative proximity of these points in the data space and hence named empirical data analysis (EDA). The ensemble functions include the nonparametric square centrality (a measure of closeness used in graph theory) and typicality (an empirically derived quantity which resembles probability). A distinctive feature of the proposed new functional approach to data analysis is that it does not assume randomness or determinism of the empirically observed data, nor independence. The typicality is derived from the discrete data directly in contrast to the traditional approach, where a continuous probability density function is assumed a priori. The typicality is expressed in a closed analytical form that can be calculated recursively and, thus, is computationally very efficient. The proposed nonparametric estimators of the ensemble properties of the data can also be interpreted as a discrete form of the information potential (known from the information theoretic learning theory as well as the Parzen windows). Therefore, EDA is very suitable for the current move to a data-rich environment, where the understanding of the underlying phenomena behind the available vast amounts of data is often not clear. We also present an extension of EDA for inference. The areas of applications of the new methodology of the EDA are wide because it concerns the very foundation of data analysis. Preliminary tests show its good performance in comparison to traditional techniques. © 2017 IEEE.},

Lending institutions at large need to have their own credit risk assessment system in accordance with Basel II guidelines. Many lending institutions lose a large amount of money as they do not have an accurate model to predict defaulters. The goal of credit risk management system is to accurately predict borrowers' ability to repay loans or make credit card payments in a timely manner. Researchers have taken multitude of approaches to solve this problem, and it continues to be an active area of research. Data mining and machine learning are emerging tools that are widely used by lending institutions to predict defaulters. These tools can effectively mine large dataset which is not feasible by traditional methods. In this work, we have used different algorithms including Deep Support Vector Machine (DSVM), Boosted Decision Tree (BDT), Averaged Perceptron (AP) and Bayes Point Machine (BPM) to build various models, in an attempt to better predict defaulters. Dataset, comprising of 25 attributes and 30k instances, was obtained from the repository of machine learning, University of California, Irvine (UCI). Our results show that, of all the four models used, DSVM can best predict defaulters. We believe that these models can be used to better predict defaulters by credit risk management system in banking and lending institutions. © 2020 IEEE.},

	volume = {14},
	abstract = {This paper analyses the relationship between macroeconomic and credit cycles. It is not a straightforward relationship, particularly in sovereign credit assessment. Modelling such a relationship requires blending scenario analysis and stress testing, together with dynamic modelling of macroeconomic and credit variables. The novelty of the presented approach is its ability to cross-pollinate machine learning and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation as part of a process that overcomes the challenges faced by risk managers. The result is a probabilistic forward-looking view of credit risk scenarios that can guide action. Sovereign credit ratings are expert opinions based on relevant macroeconomic, financial and policy information. We introduce a predictive machine learning model of sovereign credit ratings that lends itself naturally to MC simulations and stress testing. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) allows considering many variables simultaneously in a nonlinear fashion as candidates for predicting sovereign ratings. The portfolio stress testing capability comes in by augmenting the set of variables used in the MC simulations to include external shock variables common to the sovereigns in the portfolio, for example, relevant global commodity prices. The resulting rating distribution can be used to calculate different relevant risk metrics, including credit-sensitive measures of risk-weighted assets. © Henry Stewart Publications.},

	abstract = {Machine learning is increasingly being used to generate prediction models for use in a number of real-world settings, from credit risk assessment to clinical decision support. Recent discussions have highlighted potential problems in the updating of a predictive score for a binary outcome when an existing predictive score forms part of the standard workflow, driving interventions. In this setting, the existing score induces an additional causative pathway which leads to miscalibration when the original score is replaced. We propose a general causal framework to describe and address this problem, and demonstrate an equivalent formulation as a partially observed Markov decision process. We use this model to demonstrate the impact of such 'naive updating' when performed repeatedly. Namely, we show that successive predictive scores may converge to a point where they predict their own effect, or may eventually tend toward a stable oscillation between two values, and we argue that neither outcome is desirable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even if model-fitting procedures improve, actual performance may worsen. We complement these findings with a discussion of several potential routes to overcome these issues. Copyright © 2021 by the author(s)},

	abstract = {We investigate whether key audit matter (KAM) paragraphs disclosed in extended audit reports—paragraphs in which the auditor highlights significant risks and critical judgments of the company—contribute to assess corporate credit ratings. This assessment is a complicated and expensive process to grade the reliability of a company, and it is relevant for many stakeholders, such as issuers, investors, and creditors. Although credit rating evaluations have attracted the interest of many researchers, previous studies have mainly focused only on financial ratios. We are the first to use KAMs for credit rating modelling purposes. Applying four machine learning techniques to answer this real-world problem—C4.5 decision tree, two different rule induction classifiers (PART algorithm and Rough Set) and the logistic regression methodology—, our evidence suggests that by simply identifying the KAM topics disclosed in the report, any decision-maker can assess credit scores with 74\% accuracy using the rules provided by the PART algorithm. These rules specifically indicate that KAMs on both external (such as going concern) and internal (such as company debt) aspects may contribute to explaining a company’s credit rating. The rule induction classifiers have similar predictive power. Interestingly, if we combine audit data with accounting ratios, the predictive power of our model increases to 84\%, outperforming the accuracy in the existing literature. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The proposed scheme augments consumer profiles by incorporating phone usage information to alleviate the “thin file” challenge and enhance the predictive model by taking a multi-staged view of consumers' repayment timing to achieve a more finely grained credit risk determination. A three-step analysis, including prediction evaluation, model interpretation using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), and welfare analysis, was performed to evaluate our proposed scheme's efficacy. We found that phone usage information enhanced predictive performance and that underlying psychological mechanisms can be analyzed by corresponding feature interpretations to theories.

Recent evidence suggests that machine learning models have produced superior results to traditional statistical models and have become the driving force for dramatic improvement in the financial industry.

In terms of practical contributions, the study helps credit rating companies have a new method for predicting the possibility of default of bond issuers in the market.

	abstract = {In recent years, a new Internet-based unsecured credit model, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, is flourishing and has become a successful complement to the traditional credit business. However, credit risk remains inevitable. A key challenge is creating a default prediction model that can effectively and accurately predict the default probability of each loan for a P2P lending platform. Due to the characteristics of P2P lending credit data, such as high dimension and class imbalance, conventional statistical models and machine learning algorithms cannot effectively and accurately predict default probability. To address this issue, a decision tree model-based heterogeneous ensemble default prediction model is proposed in this paper for accurate prediction of customer default in P2P lending. Gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) are employed as individual classifiers to create a heterogeneous ensemble learning-based default prediction model. Learning model-based feature ranking is applied to P2P lending credit data, and individual classifiers undergo hyperparameter optimization. Finally, comparison with benchmark models shows that the prediction model can achieve desirable prediction results and thus effectively solve the challenge of predictions based on high-dimensional and imbalanced data. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Challenges in risk estimation for agricultural insurance bring to the fore statistical problems of modeling complex weather and climate dynamics, analyzing massive multi-resolution, multi-source data. Nonstationary space-time structure of such data also introduces greater complexity when assessing the highly nonlinear relationship between weather events and crop yields. In this setting, conventional parametric statistical and actuarial models may no longer be appropriate. In turn, modern machine learning and artificial intelligence procedures, which allow fast and automatic learning of hidden dependencies and structures, offer multiple operational benefits and now prove to deliver a highly competitive performance in a variety of applications, from credit card fraud detection to the next best product offer and customer segmentation. Yet their potential in actuarial sciences, and particularly agricultural insurance, remains largely untapped. In this project, we introduce a modern deep learning methodology into the assessment of climate-induced risks in agriculture and evaluate its potential to deliver a higher predictive accuracy, speed, and scalability. We present a pilot study of deep learning algorithms—specifically, deep belief networks—using historical crop yields, weather station–based records, and gridded weather reanalysis data for Manitoba, Canada from 1996 to 2011. Our findings show that deep learning can attain higher prediction accuracy, based on benchmarking its performance against more conventional approaches, especially in multiscale, heterogeneous data environments of agricultural risk management. © 2019, © 2019 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.},

But in contraction periods, the default rate tends to increase and this could be a risk for the stability of a country’s economy. Therefore, it is important to monitor the perspective of the economy in case it is expected to decrease or have abrupt movements. This work aims to identify the economic variables that determine the default rate of the Mexican Financial System and to find a machine learning model that forecasts the default rate. For this, we aggregate a dataset based on three official Mexican sources that compile data from 2013 to 2022, including the COVID-19 pandemic time frame. Then, we propose the analysis using two machine learning models. After the analysis, the results confirm that the artificial neural networks model shows better predictive power for the default rate values. We also implement an easy to use web application to estimate the default rate based on three simple variables. We anticipate this work might help on estimating the default rate and might impact on the strategic policies in the Mexican economy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ejor.2006.10.066},
	abstract = {Credit scoring is a method of modelling potential risk of credit applications. Traditionally, logistic regression and discriminant analysis are the most widely used approaches to create scoring models in the industry. However, these methods are associated with quite a few limitations, such as being instable with high-dimensional data and small sample size, intensive variable selection effort and incapability of efficiently handling non-linear features. Most importantly, based on these algorithms, it is difficult to automate the modelling process and when population changes occur, the static models usually fail to adapt and may need to be rebuilt from scratch. In the last few years, the kernel learning approach has been investigated to solve these problems. However, the existing applications of this type of methods (in particular the SVM) in credit scoring have all focused on the batch model and did not address the important problem of how to update the scoring model on-line. This paper presents a novel and practical adaptive scoring system based on an incremental kernel method. With this approach, the scoring model is adjusted according to an on-line update procedure that can always converge to the optimal solution without information loss or running into numerical difficulties. Non-linear features in the data are automatically included in the model through a kernel transformation. This approach does not require any variable reduction effort and is also robust for scoring data with a large number of attributes and highly unbalanced class distributions. Moreover, a new potential kernel function is introduced to further improve the predictive performance of the scoring model and a kernel attribute ranking technique is used that adds transparency in the final model. Experimental studies using real world data sets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Data-driven machine learning algorithms have initiated a paradigm shift in hedonic house price and rent modeling through their ability to capture highly complex and non-monotonic relationships. Their superior accuracy compared to parametric model alternatives has been demonstrated repeatedly in the literature. However, the statistical independence of the data implicitly assumed by resampling-based error estimates is unlikely to hold in a real estate context as price-formation processes in property markets are inherently spatial, which leads to spatial dependence structures in the data. When performing conventional cross-validation techniques for model selection and model assessment, spatial dependence between training and test data may lead to undetected overfitting and overoptimistic perception of predictive power. This study sheds light on the bias in cross-validation errors of tree-based algorithms induced by spatial autocorrelation and proposes a bias-reduced spatial cross-validation strategy. The findings confirm that error estimates from non-spatial resampling methods are overly optimistic, whereas spatially conscious techniques are more dependable and can increase generalizability. As accurate and unbiased error estimates are crucial to automated valuation methods, our results prove helpful for applications including, but not limited to, mass appraisal, credit risk management, portfolio allocation and investment decision making. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {A bit hurdle for financial institutions is to decide potential candidates to give a line of credit identifying the right people without any credit risk. For such a crucial decision, past demographic and financial data of debtors is important to build an automated artificial intelligence credit score prediction model based on machine learning classifier. In addition, for building robust and accurate machine learning models, important input predictors (debtor's information) must be selected. The present computational work focuses on building a credit scoring prediction model. A publicly available German credit data is incorporated in this study. An improvement in the credit scoring prediction has been shown with the use of different feature selection techniques (such as Information-gain, Gain-Ratio and Chi-Square) and machine learning classifiers (Bayesian, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree (C5.0) and SVM (support Vector Machine)). Further, a comparative analysis is performed between different machine learning classifiers and between different feature selection techniques. Different evaluation metrics are considered for analyzing performance of the models (such as accuracy, F-measure, false positive rate, false negative rate and training time). After analysis, a best combination of machine learning classifier and feature selection technique are identified. In this study, a combination of random forest (RF) and Chi-Square (CS) is found good, among other combinations, with respect to good performance accuracy, F-measure and low false positive and false negative rates. However, training time for this particular combination was found to be slightly higher. Result of C5.0 with chi-square was comparable with the best one.

	abstract = {Machine learning is an emerging technique for building analytic models for machines to learn from data and be able to do predictive analysis. The ability of machines to learn and do predictive analysis is very important in this era of big data and it has a wide range of application areas. For instance, banks and financial institutions are sometimes faced with the challenge of what risk factors to consider when advancing credit/loans to customers. For several features/attributes of the customers are normally taken into consideration, but most of these features have little predictive e ect on the credit worthiness or otherwise of the customer. Furthermore, a robust and e ective automated bank credit risk score that can aid in the prediction of customer credit worthiness very accurately is still a major challenge facing many banks. In this paper, we examine a real bank credit data and conduct several machine learning algorithms on the data for comparative analysis and to choose which algorithms are the best fit for learning bank credit data. The algorithms gave over 80\% accuracy in prediction. Furthermore, the most important features that determine whether a customer will default or otherwise in paying his/her credit the next month are extracted from a total of 23 features. We then applied these most important features on some selected machine learning algorithms and compare their predictive accuracy with the other algorithms that used all the 23 features. The results show no significant di erence, signifying that these features can accurately determine the credit worthiness of the customers. Finally, we formulate a predictive model using the most important features to predict the credit worthiness of a given customer. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The task of predicting the risk of defaulting of a lender using tools in the domain of AI is an emerging one and in growing demand, given the revolutionary potential of AI. Various attributes like income, properties acquired, educational status, and many other socioeconomic factors can be used to train a model to predict the possibilities of nonrepayment of a loan or its chances. Most of the techniques and algorithms used in this regard previously do not submit any attention to the uncertainty in predictions for out of distribution (OOD) in a dataset, which contributes to overfitting, leading to relatively lower accuracy for predicting these data points. Specifically, for credit risk classification, this is a serious concern, given the structure of the available datasets and the trend they follow. With a focus on this issue, we propose a robust and better methodology that uses a recent and efficient family of nonlinear neural network activation functions, which mimics the properties induced by the widely-used Matérn family of kernels in Gaussian process (GP) models.

Monitoring the financial status of a network, and preventing or reducing systematic risk in case of a crisis, is an area of great concern for the regulatory commission and for the banks. We set the ultimate goal of developing a visual analytic approach and tool for risk dissolving and decision-making. We have consolidated four main analysis tasks conducted by financial experts: i) Multi-faceted Default Risk Visualization, whereby a hybrid representation is devised to predict the default risk and an interface developed to visualize key indicators; ii) Risk Guarantee Patterns Discovery. We follow the Shneiderman mantra guidance for designing interactive visualization applications, whereby an interactive risk guarantee community detection and a motif detection based risk guarantee pattern discovery approach are described; iii) Network Evolution and Retrospective, whereby animation is used to help users to understand the guarantee dynamic; iv) Risk Communication Analysis. The temporal diffusion path analysis can be useful for the government and banks to monitor the spread of the default status. It also provides insight for taking precautionary measures to prevent and dissolve systematic financial risk. We implement the system with case studies using real-world bank loan data.

	abstract = {Global macroeconomic imbalance combined with deregulation of US banks and increasing US real estate prices formed the basis for aggressive growth in worldwide trading of so called Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO), i.e. similar loans pooled to create a financial derivative that can be bought or sold. The CDOs consisted mainly of prime and subprime housing loans, where the latter type is characterized by a high probability for default. Due to the growing market demand for this derivative and the subsequent shortage of prime loans, the subprime share in the CDOs increased from 43\% to 71\% from 2003 to 2007. Surprisingly the credit rating agencies did not change the top level (AAA) credit rating of the CDOs in the same period of time. How was this possible? And how could the tremendously resourceful firms that insured the derivatives by selling so called Credit Default Swaps to CDO owners avoid understanding the enormous risk they took on? What later was to be called the financial crisis emerges in the spring of 2008 in line with the fall in US real estate prices and subsequent evaporation of the CDO market. The chain of events that led to numerous bankruptcies and threw the world into a recession not seen since the early 1930s has been labeled a system crisis, liquidity crisis, and a crisis of confidence (in the financial markets) among others. In this paper we survey how, and to what extent, operational risk exposure in the organizations of mortgage brokers and banks, insurance companies, credit rating agencies, and investment banks contributed to the financial crisis. Bayesian Network analysis of causes and influencing factors in these four types of organizations indicates that operational risk exposure played a crucial role in triggering the financial crisis. Our findings suggest that the financial crisis for a large part was the result of an industry wide failure to manage risk in general, and operational risk in particular. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {We develop a macroeconomic agent-based model that consists of firms, banks, unions and households who interact on labour, goods, credit and interbank markets. The model endogenises pricing decisions by firms, wage setting by unions and interest rate setting by banks on both firm and interbank lending. Banks also set leverage targets and precautionary liquidity buffers on the basis of internal risk models. Our model produces endogenous fluctuations driven by the pricing behaviour of firms and the wage setting behaviour of unions. Fluctuations lead to loan defaults which are exacerbated as lenders reduce lending and charge higher interest rates, inducing a credit crunch. We also study how making the inter-banking network more connected affects the key outcomes of the economy and find that while the flow of funds from surplus banks to firms can be increased, the latter effect is soon dominated by increasing instability in the real sector as firms default at higher rates. While the banking sector experiences fewer defaults as a whole, losses on the interbank market increase as a source of bank defaults. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Assessing and predicting the default risk of networked-guarantee loans is critical for the commercial banks and financial regulatory authorities. The guarantee relationships between the loan companies are usually modeled as directed networks. Learning the informative low-dimensional representation of the networks is important for the default risk prediction of loan companies, even for the assessment of systematic financial risk level. In this paper, we propose a high-order graph attention representation method (HGAR) to learn the embedding of guarantee networks. Because this financial network is different from other complex networks, such as social, language, or citation networks, we set the binary roles of vertices and define high-order adjacent measures based on financial domain characteristics. We design objective functions in addition to a graph attention layer to capture the importance of nodes. We implement a productive learning strategy and prove that the complexity is near-linear with the number of edges, which could scale to large datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art method. We also evaluate the model in a real-world loan risk control system, and the results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches. © 2019 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

The prediction of default of enterprise loans is a typical extremely imbalanced prediction problem, and the networked-guarantee make this problem more difficult to solve. Since the guaranteed loan is a debt obligation promise, if one enterprise in the guarantee network falls into a financial crisis, the debt risk may spread like a virus across the guarantee network, even lead to a systemic financial crisis. In this paper, we propose an imbalanced network risk diffusion model to forecast the enterprise default risk in a short future. Positive weighted k-nearest neighbors (p-wkNN) algorithm is developed for the stand-alone case - when there is no default contagious; then a data-driven default diffusion model is integrated to further improve the prediction accuracy. We perform the empirical study on a real-world three-years loan record from a major commercial bank. The results show that our proposed method outperforms conventional credit risk methods in terms of AUC. In summary, our quantitative risk evaluation model shows promising prediction performance on real-world data, which could be useful to both regulators and stakeholders. © 2018 IEEE.},

However, the ubiquity of selecting parameters and the presence of unbalanced data sets is a very typical problem of this technique. This study aims to provide a new method for evaluating credit risk, taking into account not only financial and non-financial variables, but also the class imbalance. Design/methodology/approach: The most significant financial and non-financial variables were determined to build a credit scoring model and identify the creditworthiness of companies. Moreover, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique was used to solve the problem of class imbalance and improve the performance of the classifier. The artificial neural networks and decision trees were designed to predict default risk. Findings: Results showed that profitability ratios, repayment capacity, solvency, duration of a credit report, guarantees, size of the company, loan number, ownership structure and the corporate banking relationship duration turned out to be the key factors in predicting default. Also, both algorithms were found to be highly sensitive to class imbalance. However, with balanced data, the decision trees displayed higher predictive accuracy for the assessment of credit risk than artificial neural networks. Originality/value: Classification results depend on the appropriateness of data characteristics and the appropriate analysis algorithm for data sets. The selection of financial and non-financial variables, as well as the resolution of class imbalance allows companies to assess their credit risk successfully. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Feature selection is a preprocessing technique commonly used on high dimensional data and its purposes include reducing dimensionality, removing irrelevant and redundant features, facilitating data understanding, reducing the amount of data needed for learning, improving predictive accuracy of algorithms, and increasing interpretability of models. In this paper we investigate the extent to which the total data, owned by a bank, can be a good basis for predicting the borrower's ability to repay the loan on time. We propose a feature selection technique for finding an optimum feature subset that enhances the classification accuracy of neural network classifiers.

We find that, in general, many different clearing vectors can arise, among which there is a greatest clearing vector, arrived at by letting banks fail in succession until only solvent banks remain. Such a collapse should be prevented if at all possible. We then study situations in which consortia of banks may have the means and incentives to rescue failing banks. This again departs from the conclusions of the earlier work of Eisenberg and Noe, where in the absence of default losses there would be no incentive for solvent banks to rescue failing banks. We conclude with some remarks about how a rescue consortium might be constructed. © 2013 INFORMS.},

	doi = {10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3027346},
	abstract = {Under debt obligation promises, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can guarantee each other to enhance their financial security to get loans from commercial banks. When the economy rises, the banks may reduce the threshold to some extent, which may introduce default risk during the economy down period, especially when many SMEs bind together and form complex networks. The risk may diffuse across the guarantee network and may result in a financial crisis. Macroprudential oversight of the guarantee network to eliminate any potential systematics financial risk is the central task of the regulatory commission and the commercial banks. Based on our observation, the delinquent probability of an SME depends not only on self-financial status but also highly related to its temporal behaviors and structural position in networks. The classic approach for loan assessment criteria face challenges in extracting temporal and structural patterns from dynamic networks. To address these issues, we propose a temporal delinquent event prediction (TDEP) framework that preserves temporal network structures and credit behavior sequences in an end-to-end model. In particular, we first employ a graph attention layer to learn the representation of nodes in temporal guarantee networks. We then design a recursive and self-attention mechanism to integrate both credit behavior and network structure information. The learned attentional weights are leveraged to uncover high-risk guarantee patterns that effectively accelerate the risk assessment process. Afterward, we conduct extensive experiments in a real-world guaranteed-loan data set to evaluate its performance. The results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared with the state-of-the-art baselines. Finally, we integrate the proposed model in a real-world loan risk management system. We present the implementation details of each subcomponent of the system and report out the performance after online deployment. © 2012 IEEE.},

However, insufficient credit information limits the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform's capacity to build effective credit scoring.

Whether social network information can be used to strengthen financial institutions' predictive power has received much attention in the industry and academia. The aim of this study is to test the reliability of social network information in predicting loan default. We extract borrowers' social network information from mobile phones and then use logistic regression to test the relationship between social network information and loan default. Three machine learning algorithms-random forest, AdaBoost, and LightGBM-were constructed to demonstrate the predictive performance of social network information. The logistic regression results show that there is a statistically significant correlation between social network information and loan default. The machine learning algorithm results show that social network information can improve loan default prediction performance significantly. The experiment results suggest that social network information is valuable for credit scoring. © 2019 by the authors.},

The expansion of these networks increases the fragility of a financial system as a result of the regional and industrial risk contagion embedded within them. By providing a theoretical framework of a loan guarantee network, a method is proposed for calculating the amount of risk spillover caused by loan guarantees taking the perspective of the entire network. In addition, the route of risk contagion in guarantee networks is analyzed, revealing that when default risk shocks occur, risk contagion travels along the nodes not once but for several rounds and that the risk control of one firm cannot prevent these systemic risks. Therefore, a risk control scheme is designed based on the location and importance of firms in the network. Using data from a real guarantee network, we demonstrate that identifying the node locations of firms’ in the guarantee network (including the coritivity and closeness of the firm) can help in understanding risk contagion mechanisms and preventing systemic credit risk before a crisis occurs. © 2017, Institute of Systems Science, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {The credit risk of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in supply chain finance (SCF) is defined as the probability that the SME would default on loans derived from financing for the SCF platform. Traditional models make use of merely the static data of SMEs, such as enterprise demographic data and financial statement data, to predict the credit risk of SMEs in SCF. Nevertheless, behavioral data, which reflect the dynamic financing behavior of SMEs in SCF, are overlooked by these models, which limits the performance of credit risk prediction. To address this problem, a novel approach is proposed called DeepRisk to fuse enterprise demographic data and financing behavioral data to predict the credit risk of SMEs in SCF. We adopt the multi-modal learning strategy to fuse the two different sources of data. The concatenated vectors derived from data fusion are then used as the input of the feed forward neural network to predict the credit risk of SMEs. Experiments on a real SCF dataset demonstrate that the proposed DeepRisk approach outperforms the baseline methods in credit risk prediction in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, area under curve (AUC), and economic loss. The fusion of the two different sources of data is superior to the existing approaches to the credit risk prediction of SMEs in SCF. Both the static enterprise demographic data and the dynamic financing behavioral data are crucial to improve the credit risk prediction of SMEs. Nevertheless, the variables derived from the financing behavioral data have a better predictability than those from the enterprise demographic data. Managerial implications have been identified for decision makers involved in SCF in utilizing the benefits of SCF and in managing their credit risks. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

However, external shocks may weaken the robustness, and an accidental default may spread across the network and lead to large-scale defaults, even systemic crisis. Thus, predicting and rating the default contagion chains in the guarantee network in order to reduce or prevent potential systemic financial risk, attracts a grave concern from the Regulatory Authority and the banks. Existing credit risk models in the banking industry utilize machine learning methods to generate a credit score for each customer. Such approaches dismiss the contagion risk from guarantee chains and need extensive feature engineering with deep domain expertise. To this end, we propose a novel approach to rate the risk of contagion chains in the bank industry with the deep neural network. We employed the temporal inter-chain attention network on graph-structured loan behavior data to compute risk scores for the contagion chains. We show that our approach is significantly better than the state-of-the-art baselines on the dataset from a major financial institution in Asia. Besides, we conducted empirical studies on the real-world loan dataset for risk assessment.

The paper examines the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for oversampling. A few prior studies have used GANs for this purpose but do not reflect recent methodological advancements for generating tabular data using GANs. The paper proposes an approach based on a conditional Wasserstein GAN that can effectively model tabular datasets with numerical and categorical variables and pays special attention to the down-stream classification task through an auxiliary classifier loss. We focus on a credit scoring context in which binary classifiers predict the default risk of loan applications. Empirical comparisons in this context evidence the competitiveness of GAN-based oversampling compared to several standard oversampling regimes. We also clarify the conditions under which oversampling in general and the proposed GAN-based approach in particular raise predictive performance. In sum, our findings suggest that GAN architectures for tabular data and our extensions deserve a place in data scientists’ modelling toolbox. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

We show that lenders mostly behave rationally and charge appropriate risk premiums for antecedents of loan default. We also show that there are mismatches between risk premiums charged and relative importance of factors that drive loan default. We then explore the dynamic process of lenders adjusting their lending strategies to reduce these mismatches. We analyze the effectiveness of the group reputation used in the marketplace and show that it is not effective in promoting good borrower behavior. Our analysis provides a base for future research in this exciting and evolving context.

	doi = {10.1145/3357384.3357804},
	abstract = {Commercial banks normally require Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to provide their warranties when applying for a loan. If the borrower defaults, the guarantor is obligated to repay its loan. Such a guarantee system is designed to reduce delinquent risks, but may introduce a new dimension risk if more and more SMEs involve and subsequently form complex temporal networks. Monitoring the financial status of SMEs in these networks, and preventing or reducing systematic loan risk, is an area of great concern for both the regulatory commission and the banks. To allow possible actions to be taken in advance, this paper studies the problem of predicting repayment delinquency in the networked-guarantee loans. We propose a dynamic default prediction framework (DDPF), which preserves temporal network structures and loan behavior sequences in an end-to-end model. In particular, we design a gated recursive and attention mechanism to integrate both the loan behavior and network information. Then, we uncover risky warrant patterns by the learned weights, which effectively accelerate risk evaluation process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments in a real-world loan risk control system to evaluate its performance, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared with state-of-the-art baselines. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	volume = {5},
	doi = {10.1186/s40854-019-0121-9},
	abstract = {Giving loans and issuing credit cards are two of the main concerns of banks in that they include the risks of non-payment. According to the Basel 2 guidelines, banks need to develop their own credit risk assessment systems. Some banks have such systems; nevertheless they have lost a large amount of money simply because the models they used failed to accurately predict customers’ defaults. Traditionally, banks have used static models with demographic or static factors to model credit risk patterns. However, economic factors are not independent of political fluctuations, and as the political environment changes, the economic environment evolves with it. This has been especially evident in Iran after the 2008–2016 USA sanctions, as many previously reliable customers became unable to repay their debt (i.e., became bad customers). Nevertheless, a dynamic model that can accommodate fluctuating politico-economic factors has never been developed. In this paper, we propose a model that can accommodate factors associated with politico-economic crises. Human judgement is removed from the customer evaluation process. We used a fuzzy inference system to create a rule base using a set of uncertainty predictors. First, we train an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) using monthly data from a customer profile dataset. Then, using the newly defined factors and their underlying rules, a second round of assessment begins in a fuzzy inference system. Thus, we present a model that is both more flexible to politico-economic factors and can yield results that are max compatible with real-life situations. Comparison between the prediction made by proposed model and a real non-performing loan indicates little difference between them. Credit risk specialists also approve the results. The major innovation of this research is producing a table of bad customers on a monthly basis and creating a dynamic model based on the table. The latest created model is used for assessing customers henceforth, so the whole process of customer assessment need not be repeated. We assert that this model is a good substitute for the static models currently in use as it can outperform traditional models, especially in the face of economic crisis. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	volume = {1},
	doi = {10.1186/s40854-015-0014-5},
	abstract = {Background: Supply chain finance (SCF) is a series of financial solutions provided by financial institutions to suppliers and customers facing demands on their working capital. As a systematic arrangement, SCF utilizes the authenticity of the trade between (SMEs) and their “counterparties”, which are usually the leading enterprises in their supply chains. Because in these arrangements the leading enterprises are the guarantors for the SMEs, the credit levels of such counterparties are becoming important factors of concern to financial institutions’ risk management (i.e., commercial banks offering SCF services). Thus, these institutions need to assess the credit risks of the SMEs from a view of the supply chain, rather than only assessing an SME’s repayment ability. The aim of this paper is to research credit risk assessment models for SCF. Methods: We establish an index system for credit risk assessment, adopting a view of the supply chain that considers the leading enterprise’s credit status and the relationships developed in the supply chain. Furthermore, We conducted two credit risk assessment models based on support vector machine (SVM) technique and BP neural network respectly. Results: (1) The SCF credit risk assessment index system designed in this paper, which contained supply chain leading enterprise’s credit status and cooperative relationships between SMEs and leading enterprises, can help banks to raise their accuracy on predicting a small and medium enterprise whether default or not. Therefore, more SMEs can obtain loans from banks through SCF. (2) The SCF credit risk assessment model based on SVM is of good generalization ability and robustness, which is more effective than BP neural network assessment model. Hence, Banks can raise the accuracy of credit risk assessment on SMEs by applying the SVM model, which can alleviate credit rationing on SMEs. Conclusions: (1)The SCF credit risk assessment index system can solve the problem of banks incorrectly labeling a creditworthy enterprise as a default enterprise, and thereby improve the credit rating status in the process of SME financing. (2)By analyzing and comparing the empirical results, we find that the SVM assessment model, on evaluating the SME credit risk, is more effective than the BP neural network assessment model. This new assessment model based on SVM can raise the accuracy of classification between good credit and bad credit SMEs. (3)Therefore, the SCF credit risk assessment index system and the assessment model based on SVM, is the optimal combination for commercial banks to use to evaluate SMEs’ credit risk. © 2015, Zhang et al.},

	doi = {10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2948949},
	abstract = {In recent years, the technology about IoT (Internet of Things) has been applied into finance domain, and the generated data, such as the real-time data of chattel mortgage supervision with GPS, sensors, network cameras, mobile devices, etc., has been used to improve the capability of financial credit risk management of bank loans. Financial credit risk is by far one of the most significant risks that commercial banks have to face, however, when confronting to the massively growing financial data from multiple sources including Internet, mobile networks or IoT, traditional statistical models and neural network models might not operate fairly or accurately enough for credit risk assessment with those diverse data. Hence, there is a practical need to establish more powerful risk prediction models with artificial intelligence based on big data analytics to predict default behaviors with better accuracy and capacity. In this article, a big data mining approach of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based Backpropagation (BP) neural network is proposed for financial risk management in commercial banks with IoT deployment, which constructs a nonlinear parallel optimization model with Apache Spark and Hadoop HDFS techniques on the dataset of on-balance sheet item and off-balance sheet item. The experiment results indicate that this parallel risk management model has fast convergence rate and powerful predictive capacity, and performs efficiently in screening default behaviors. In the meanwhile, the distributed implementation on big data clusters largely reduces the processing time of model training and testing. © 2013 IEEE.},

Biased self-attribution adds positive short-lag autocorrelations ("momentum")s, hort-run earnings "drift,"but negative correlation between future returns and long-term past stock market and accounting performranceT. he theory also offers several untested implications and implications for corporate financial policy.},

After that, according to the existing researches, we simply introduce the TODIM method and TODIM method under 2TLPFSs. Furthermore, we propose the TODIM method based on CPT (CPT–TODIM) for multiple attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) with 2TLPFSs. Finally, a numerical example about company credit risk assessment is used to explain the new proposed method. Comparing with other methods, there is no doubt that this new method has superiority. To be exact, because the new method fully considers the mental factors of decision makers, it can better solve the uncertainty of MAGDM and improve the rationality of decision-making. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

The present study proposes a comprehensive assessment method that incorporates both conventional data, such as individual socio-demographic information and loan application information, and data for the applicant's dynamic transaction behavior. Our method is based on Radial Basis Function (RBF) Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which extracts features from a person's transaction behavior history.

Using Chines micro-enterprise credit data set, this study emphasizes the multidimensional analysis of credit risk, such as the whole sample, subsample, and the incremental effect of the group of predictors. To that end, relative variable importance (RVIs) has been presented for all predictors according to the contribution in the prediction accuracy so that to ensure interpretability of the model. The empirical findings confirm that RF technique is reliable and efficient across all of the criteria used in this study. In addition, the examined experimental analysis indicates that non-traditional variables have a significant effect on the classification accuracy. Thus, this paper recommends some alternative predictors like the legal representative's basic information, internal non-financial factors, along with traditional financial variables for sustainable model development. The performance is compared from the perspective of five different performance measures.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new approach based on the kernel-free quadratic surface support vector machine model to handle a binary classification problem with mislabeled information. Unlike the traditional fuzzy and robust support vector machine models that reduce the weights of suspectable mislabeled points or even discard them, our new method first adopts the intuitionistic fuzzy set method to detect those suspectable mislabeled points, then deletes their labels, and indiscriminately utilizes their full position information to build a semisupervised model. In this way, we can not only eliminate the negative effect of mislabeled information but also avoid the difficult task of searching proper kernel functions in classical SVM models. Besides, to improve the efficiency and accuracy, a branch-and-bound algorithm is designed to accelerate the solving process. After that, we conduct some numerical tests with both artificial and real-world datasets to verify the superior performance of our proposed method among several benchmark methods. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to brain-computer interface and credit risk assessment.

The results showed that the RF algorithm model had the best classification effect and could accurately analyze the risks of Internet finance in terms of market, law, credit, personal information, and professional knowledge. It was found that credit and personal information risk were the most important factors in the future development of Internet finance when BP neural network was used to evaluate these risks. To a certain extent, they would also hinder the use and development of Internet finance. At the same time, it proved that BP neural network had a good prediction effect.

Compared with a traditional electricity transaction, the default problem in DER transactions is more serious due to the uncertainty of DER outputs and owners' desire of profits. This paper presented a credit management method for DER transactions by using blockchain technology. Firstly, the sources and damages of the credit risk in DER transactions were analyzed and a credit evaluation index in DER transaction was introduced. Then, a DER transaction model based on blockchain was presented. In the credit risk management process, a credit assessment technology for DER transaction based on blockchain was proposed that can assess the credit of DERs in a transparent and just manner. A credit risk control mechanism based on PoC (proof-of-credit) consensus algorithm was proposed. The algorithm encourages participants to maintain their credit scores in an incentive compatible way and avoids the credit problem in the DER transaction. Simulation results show that, with the proposed DER transaction smart contract and the credit risk control mechanism, participants with higher credit scores gain more profits than those with lower credit scores. © 2019 Chin.

The optimal segmentation algorithm is improved and applied to the training of RBF neural network parameters in this paper to increase the center and width of the class, and the center and width of the RBF network model are further improved. Finally, the adaptive selection of the number of hidden nodes is realized by using the differential objective function of the class to adjust dynamically the structure of the radial basis function network model, which is used to establish the credit rating model.

However, no overall distinguished methods have been used in predicting bond ratings. Moreover, recent studies have suggested ensembles of classifiers that may be used in bond rating prediction. This article proposes an improved machine learning aimed to predict the rating of financial bonds.

	doi = {10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2018.12.001},
	abstract = {Financial decisions are often based on classification models which are used to assign a set of observations into predefined groups. Different data classification models were developed to foresee the financial crisis of an organization using their historical data. One important step towards the development of accurate financial crisis prediction (FCP) model involves the selection of appropriate variables (features) which are relevant for the problems at hand. This is termed as feature selection problem which helps to improve the classification performance. This paper proposes an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based financial crisis prediction (FCP) model which incorporates two phases: ACO based feature selection (ACO-FS) algorithm and ACO based data classification (ACO-DC) algorithm. The proposed ACO-FCP model is validated using a set of five benchmark dataset includes both qualitative and quantitative. For feature selection design, the developed ACO-FS method is compared with three existing feature selection algorithms namely genetic algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm. In addition, a comparison of classification results is also made between ACO-DC and state of art methods. Experimental analysis shows that the ACO-FCP ensemble model is superior and more robust than its counterparts. In consequence, this study strongly recommends that the proposed ACO-FCP model is highly competitive than traditional and other artificial intelligence techniques. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

We also introduce asymmetric loss functions that only penalize the LGD forecast errors that lead to underestimate the regulatory capital. We show theoretically that our approach ranks models differently compared to the traditional approach which only focuses on LGD forecast errors. We apply our methodology to six competing LGD models using a sample of almost 10,000 defaulted credit and leasing contracts provided by an international bank. Our empirical findings clearly show that models’ rankings based on capital charge losses differ from those based on the LGD loss functions currently used by regulators, banks, and academics. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Hesitant multiplicative preference relation (HMPR) contains much more comprehensive information than the traditional multiplicative preference relations. The HMPR is a useful tool to help the decision makers express their preferences in group decision making under uncertainty. The key of group decision making with the HMPR is to derive the priority weights from the HMPR. Thus, an efficient and practical priority method should be put forward so as to ensure the reasonability of the final decision result. In order to do that, in this paper, we first introduce the expected value and the geometric average value of hesitant multiplicative element (HME) which is the component of the HMPR. Then from different perspectives, we utilize the error-analysis technique to put forward three novel methods for the priorities of the HMPR, i.e., the expectation value method, the geometric average value method, and the multiplicative deviation method. We also investigate the relationships among these methods, and develop an approach to group decision making with the HMPR by using the methods and the possibility degree formula. Finally, by constructing the indicator system for credit risk evaluation of supply chain enterprises, we make a detailed case study concerning Lu-Zhou-Lao-Jiao (the well-known liquor enterprise in China) to demonstrate our approach. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The main challenge for individual investors in the P2P lending market is to allocate their money efficiently through different loans by accurately evaluating the credit of each loan. The traditional ranking models cannot conform to the needs of individual investors in P2P lending because they do not provide natural mechanisms for asset allocation. P2P loans do not have the presence of traditional financial institutions. In this study, we propose a novel method for analyzing data for this emerging market. We have designed a credit risk model based on advanced machine learning methods, capable of assessing the returns and risks of individual loans. We also applied a selection feature method to eliminate the irrelevant features for improving the efficient of machine learning models.

We designed an instance-based credit risk assessment model, which has the ability of evaluating the return and risk of each individual loan. Moreover, we formulated the investment decision in P2P lending as a portfolio optimization problem with boundary constraints. To validate the proposed model, we performed extensive experiments on real-world datasets from two notable P2P lending marketplaces.

In recent times, the hybrid prediction model, a combination of traditional and modern artificial intelligence (AI) methods that provides better prediction capacity than the use of single techniques, has been introduced. Similarly, using conventional and topical artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, researchers have recommended hybrid models which amalgamate logistic regression (LR) with multilayer perceptron (MLP). To investigate the efficiency and viability of the proposed hybrid models, we compared 16 hybrid models created by combining logistic regression (LR), discriminant analysis (DA), and decision trees (DT) with four types of neural network (NN): adaptive neurofuzzy inference systems (ANFISs), deep neural networks (DNNs), radial basis function networks (RBFs) and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). The experimental outcome, investigation, and statistical examination express the capacity of the planned hybrid model to develop a credit risk prediction technique different from all other approaches, as indicated by ten different performance measures.

	doi = {10.1080/03610926.2014.968730},
	abstract = {Traditional credit risk assessment models do not consider the time factor; they only think of whether a customer will default, but not the when to default. The result cannot provide a manager to make the profit-maximum decision. Actually, even if a customer defaults, the financial institution still can gain profit in some conditions. Nowadays, most research applied the Cox proportional hazards model into their credit scoring models, predicting the time when a customer is most likely to default, to solve the credit risk assessment problem. However, in order to fully utilize the fully dynamic capability of the Cox proportional hazards model, time-varying macroeconomic variables are required which involve more advanced data collection. Since short-term default cases are the ones that bring a great loss for a financial institution, instead of predicting when a loan will default, a loan manager is more interested in identifying those applications which may default within a short period of time when approving loan applications. This paper proposes a decision tree-based short-term default credit risk assessment model to assess the credit risk. The goal is to use the decision tree to filter the short-term default to produce a highly accurate model that could distinguish default lending. This paper integrates bootstrap aggregating (Bagging) with a synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) into the credit risk model to improve the decision tree stability and its performance on unbalanced data. Finally, a real case of small and medium enterprise loan data that has been drawn from a local financial institution located in Taiwan is presented to further illustrate the proposed approach. After comparing the result that was obtained from the proposed approach with the logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models, it was found that the classifying recall rate and precision rate of the proposed model was obviously superior to the logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models. © 2016 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Previous analysis has shown that applying Bayes minimum risk to detect credit card fraud leads to better results measured by monetary savings, as compared with traditional methodologies. Nevertheless, this approach requires good probability estimates that not only separate well between positive and negative examples, but also assess the real probability of the event. Unfortunately, not all classification algorithms satisfy this restriction. In this paper, two different methods for calibrating probabilities are evaluated and analyzed in the context of credit card fraud detection, with the objective of finding the model that minimizes the real losses due to fraud. Even though under-sampling is often used in the context of classification with unbalanced datasets, it is shown that when probabilistic models are used to make decisions based on minimizing risk, using the full dataset provides significantly better results. In order to test the algorithms, a real dataset provided by a large European card processing company is used. It is shown that by calibrating the probabilities and then using Bayes minimum Risk the losses due to fraud are reduced. Furthermore, because of the good overall results, the aforementioned card processing company is currently incorporating the methodology proposed in this paper into their fraud detection system. Finally, the methodology has been tested on a different application, namely, direct marketing. © SIAM.},

	doi = {10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3033784},
	abstract = {Financial threats are displaying a trend about the credit risk of commercial banks as the incredible improvement in the financial industry has arisen. In this way, one of the biggest threats faces by commercial banks is the risk prediction of credit clients. Recent studies mostly focus on enhancing the classifier performance for credit card default prediction rather than an interpretable model. In classification problems, an imbalanced dataset is also crucial to improve the performance of the model because most of the cases lied in one class, and only a few examples are in other categories. Traditional statistical approaches are not suitable to deal with imbalanced data. In this study, a model is developed for credit default prediction by employing various credit-related datasets. There is often a significant difference between the minimum and maximum values in different features, so Min-Max normalization is used to scale the features within one range. Data level resampling techniques are employed to overcome the problem of the data imbalance. Various undersampling and oversampling methods are used to resolve the issue of class imbalance. Different machine learning models are also employed to obtain efficient results. We developed the hypothesis of whether developed models using different machine learning techniques are significantly the same or different and whether resampling techniques significantly improves the performance of the proposed models. One-way Analysis of Variance is a hypothesis-testing technique, used to test the significance of the results. The split method is utilized to validate the results in which data has split into training and test sets. The results on imbalanced datasets show the accuracy of 66.9\% on Taiwan clients credit dataset, 70.7\% on South German clients credit dataset, and 65\% on Belgium clients credit dataset. Conversely, the results using our proposed methods significantly improve the accuracy of 89\% on Taiwan clients credit dataset, 84.6\% on South German clients credit dataset, and 87.1\% on Belgium clients credit dataset. The results show that the performance of classifiers is better on the balanced dataset as compared to the imbalanced dataset. It is also observed that the performance of data oversampling techniques are better than undersampling techniques. Overall, the Gradient Boosted Decision Tree method performs better than other traditional machine learning classifiers. The Gradient Boosted Decision Tree method gives the best results while utilizing the K-means SMOTE oversampling method. Using one-way ANOVA, the null hypothesis was rejected by a p-value ¡0.001, hence confirming that the proposed model improved performance is statistical significance. The interpretable model is also deployed on the web to ease the different stakeholders. This model will help commercial banks, financial organizations, loan institutes, and other decision-makers to predict the loan defaulter earlier. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

We investigate 3 possible drivers of DeFi returns: exposure to the cryptocurrency market, the network effect, and the valuation ratio. As DeFi tokens are distinct from classical cryptocurrencies, we designed a new dedicated market index, denoted iDeFiX. We compare our index with the one created by Nasdaq and obtain similar results. First, we show that DeFi tokens returns are driven by their own network variables and the cryptocurrency market. We construct a valuation ratio for the DeFi market by dividing the Total Value Locked (TVL) by the Market Capitalization (MC). Our findings do not support the assumption regarding TVL/MC exposure. Overall, our empirical study shows that the impact of the cryptocurrency market on DeFi returns is stronger than any other considered driver and provides superior explanatory power. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In the emerging platform economy, blockchain technologies are reshaping the digital economy. Moreover, disintermediation and decentralization have broken new ground for platform organizations and management mechanisms and instigated the concept of a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). Recent literature on operations management has called for further research on governance issues related to DAOs. In response to this call, we explore the relationship between DAO management efforts and platform performance in this study. Specifically, we propose and theoretically articulate decentralized voting tasks in DAOs as a new form of organizing. Harnessing both online and on-chain data from seven sources, we empirically examine how voting task division, task allocation, reward distribution, and information provision affect platform performance in the context of MakerDAO (an Ethereum-based stablecoin issuance platform). Our findings reveal that strategic decisions arrived at through voting have a positive impact on platform operational performance under certain conditions, whereas operational decisions resulting from voting have a negative impact. Moreover, we elucidate the moderating effects of voting task execution characteristics on the relationship between completed decision tasks and operational performance. These findings have important implications from both theoretical and practical perspectives. We also share all the raw data we use to promote the development of blockchain-related empirical research. © 2022 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.},

Little is known, however, about the underlying reasons for this vulnerability. Here we develop an agent-based model to study how features of cryptocurrency networks contribute to their vulnerability to double-spending attacks. Perhaps surprisingly, we find neither the number of network nodes nor its path length seem to influence the probability of successful attacks. We find robust evidence that the network's clustering coefficient has substantial influence. In particular, scale-free networks, with their small clustering coefficients, are more than twice as likely to succumb to double-spending attacks than are networks with larger coefficients, such as regular networks. The implication is that cryptocurrency networks, which are scale-free, may be uniquely susceptible to double-spending attacks. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

Using a spectrum of approaches, including Granger causality across quantiles, cross-quantilograms, and dynamic connectedness, we provide novel evidence on the nexus between Bitcoin mining and climate change. First, we find a significant Granger causality between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the energy usage of Bitcoin that concentrates on the right-tail quantiles. Second, we show that the directional predictability from hash rate, blockchain size, and Bitcoin returns to Bitcoin electricity consumption is heterogeneous. We also discover significant directional predictability between the energy usage of Bitcoin mining and CO2 emissions. Third, the dynamic connectedness results show that hash rate transmits the most substantial net spillover effects to CO2 emissions and Bitcoin electricity consumption. Accordingly, hash rate exerts a major influence on Bitcoin electricity consumption and climate change. This study highlights the necessity of stimulating technological advances in developing energy-efficient decentralized finance consensus algorithms to transform the cryptocurrency market into a climate-friendly market. The results provide policy implications by emphasizing the importance of cryptocurrency ecosystem decarbonization in addressing environmental concerns. © 2022},

	abstract = {Decentralized finance, or ‘De-Fi’, is an emerging sector and movement in finance and the cryptocurrency space that aims to extend the idea of digital currencies to a global decentralized financial system. In many cases, customized ‘coins’ or ‘tokens’ are used for applications such as borrowing or lending, providing liquidity, and even voting. Built on the same foundations of traditional cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin), these tokens possess monetary value and can be traded using fiat currencies on specialized decentralized exchanges. We provide the first analysis investigating the market efficiency of the decentralized finance market through DeFi tokens. Our findings from applying the adaptive market hypothesis (AMH) revealed that the efficiency of the markets varies over time, with the majority of the DeFi token returns exhibit very short days of inefficiency and predictability in their price every year. This is consistent with the AMH, but perhaps unexpected when considering the link between emerging financial markets and market efficiency. We conclude that the majority of investors and practitioners purchase these DeFi tokens for their utility value rather than for investment purposes, hence making the DeFi market more efficient. Further robustness checks on other comparable products in the blockchain ecosystem such as NFTs also reveal similar results. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

Traditional economic theories are inadequate for interpreting market responses driven by people’s subjective thinking, as these cognitive processes are not encompassed by the concept of utility. We explore these effects by using computational linguistics and deep structured learning algorithms to analyze financial newspapers and social media posts. After controlling for factors related to content and market momentum in our narrative based credibility indicator, we find that news credibility is positively correlated with the returns on assets preferred by experts and negatively correlated with assets preferred by gamblers. Based on this finding, we point out that the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is not appropriate in the dominant market of gamblers in the short-term.

	doi = {10.1145/3490486.3538250},
	abstract = {We present a novel way for cryptocurrency miners to manipulate the effective interest-rate on loans or deposits they make on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms by manipulating difficulty-adjustment algorithms (DAAs) and changing the block-rate. This presents a new class of strategic manipulations available to miners. These manipulations allow miners to stretch and squeeze the time between consecutive blocks. We analyze these manipulations both analytically and empirically, and show that a 25\% miner can stretch the time between consecutive blocks by up to 54\% in Ethereum and 33\% in Bitcoin, and squeeze it by up to 9\% in Ethereum. Ethereum is particularly vulnerable, and even relatively small miners can seriously affect the block-rate. An interesting application of these manipulations is to create an artificial interest-rate gap between loans taken from one DeFi platform which accrues interest according to block height (such as Compound [66]) and deposited in some other platform that does so according to elapsed time (like a bank, or other DeFi platforms such as Aave [99]). Hence, stretching and squeezing the block-rate can decrease the interest paid on DeFi loans relative to external financial platforms. The profit made from this interest-rate gap provides a large incentive for miners to deviate. For example, a 25\% Ethereum miner using our manipulations can increase mining profits by up to 35\%, even after taking potential losses into consideration, such as less block-rewards. Our analysis of these manipulations and their mitigations has broad implications with regards to commonly-used cryptocurrency mechanisms and paradigms, such as Ethereum's difficulty-adjustment algorithm and reward schemes, with Ethereum's handling of uncle blocks being particularly manipulable. Interestingly, Bitcoin's mechanism is more resistant Ethereum's, owing to its larger incentives and a more resilient DAA. © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {This study analyses the determinants of interest rates in the cryptocurrency lending market using a unique database from the Decentralised Finance platform. We confirm the existence of both mediation and moderation effects in the cryptocurrency lending market by employing a moderated mediation model. First, the empirical results show that the interest rate is closely related to the loan-to-value ratio, which works as the mediation variable in lending. Second, the interest rate reveals a clear connection with price fluctuations of Bitcoin. This brings up the momentum phenomenon in the lending process and incentives borrowers to acquire more money, leading to pro-cyclical speculation. Third, the lending amount reflects a moderation effect in the lending market, and the net effect of the currency price on the interest rate turns negative when the loan amount exceeds a threshold, resulting in the ‘seesaw’ effect in cryptocurrency lending. The above findings confirm that cryptocurrency lending reflects a certain degree of option characteristics and complies with the risk-debt model, which provides more evidence for understanding the momentum phenomenon and investor behaviour in the cryptocurrency lending market. © 2021},

	title = {Cryptocurrencies: {The} future of finance?},
	abstract = {Since 2009, more than 1600 cryptocurrencies have entered into circulation. The rapid development of the cryptocurrency market has raised questions about whether cryptocurrencies will challenge the existing order of traditional financial institutions. Opinion remains divided. Some commentators predict that they will cause massive disruptions to the current financial system. Others claim that they are unlikely to represent the “future of money”. Opponents have expressed concern over the association between cryptocurrencies and serious crimes, resemblance to Ponzi-schemes and the increasing incidence of crypto-scams. Supporters advocate that they offer a revolutionary system of payment, an alternative investment method or an alternative means of raising funds. The legal treatment of cryptocurrencies is, however, one of the most decisive factors that will determine their future. Currently, there is no governmental consensus on how, or if, cryptocurrencies should be regulated. Some governments are issuing outright bans on specific cryptocurrency activity; others are taking positive steps by introducing legislation to legitimize their use; the remainder are undecided whether to act or not. The methodology adopted in this research is a simple SWOT analysis to assess the durability and competitive positioning of cryptocurrencies. This chapter concludes that cryptocurrencies will cause disruptions to the future of money. It is expected that they will become a permanent new institution; however, they will be far more advanced than the current generation, be heavily governed by regulation and are likely to be state-issued. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

The article is aimed at identifying the priority directions of transformations taking place in the cryp-tocurrency market in the conditions of the Covid-19 pandemic under the influence of certain groups of factors. System and network approaches to understanding the cryp-tocurrency market have been identified. The cryptocurrency market is considered from a functional and institutional point of view. From a functional point of view, the crypto-currency market is a set of economic relations in cyberspace regarding cryptocurrency mining, initial coin offering (ICO) and circulation of cryptocurrencies based on the laws of supply and demand. From an institutional point of view, the cryptocurrency market is a set of participants in virtual currency schemes who carry out cryptocurrency trans-actions. The following signs of cryptocurrency market segmentation are justified such as those depending on the market capitalization of the cryptocurrency; on the nature of the crypto asset's movement; on operations carried out on the market; on the region; on consumers of services. Factors that influence the functioning of the cryptocurrency market are systematized according to the following groups: macroeconomic, price, en-vironmental, geographic, market, behavioral and technological. The influence of gold, oil prices, the daily number of Covid-19 cases and deaths from Covid-19, the MSCI ACWI global stock index, the iShares MSCI All Country Asia ex Japan ETF, the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index on the Bitcoin exchange rate is revealed. The trends in the crypto-currency market development in the post-war period are justified, namely the growth of investors' interest in cryptocurrencies against the background of the initial coin offering collapse; growth of payments in cryptocurrencies; strengthening the regulatory landscape on a global and national scale; integration of the cryptocurrency market with traditional finance; attracting non-typical participants to the cryptocurrency business; expansion of participants in the infrastructure of the cryptocurrency market due to the rapid cryptocurrency market development, in particular, due to the production of equip-ment for its operation. © 2022 by the author(s).},

The existence and development of blockchain technology make cryptocurrency in recent years believably become a complete alternative to traditional ones.

Though being the most prominent cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has not been a legal trading currency in various countries. Its exchange rate has appeared to be an exceptionally high-risk portfolio with extreme volatility, which requires a more detailed evaluation before making any decision. This paper utilizes knowledge of statistics for financial time series and machine learning to (i) fit the parametric distribution and (ii) model and forecast the volatility of Bitcoin returns, and (iii) analyze its correlation to other financial market indicators. The fitted parametric time series model significantly outperforms other standard models in explaining the stylized facts and statistical variances in the behavior of Bitcoin returns. The model forecast also outperforms some machine learning methodologies, which would benefit policy makers, banks and financial investors in trading activities for both long-term and short-term strategies. © 2017 IEEE.},

Fintech disruption is a deviation from the norm, resulting in a significant shift in banking services and, as a result, risk. This article aims to investigate how Fintech has influenced recent changes in the banking industry and upcoming challenges, with a particular emphasis on blockchain technology. We perform a comprehensive thematic analysis of recent studies on Fintech in the banking industry. We found that Fintech has enormous potential to grow and impact the banking industry and the entire world. The banking industry could benefit from combining emerging technologies such as blockchain, AI, machine learning, or other decision-making layers. However, with the benefits come drawbacks, such as increased reliance on technology, high costs, increased job losses, security risks related to data and fraud, and so on. The use of emerging technology and collaboration between Fintech firms and banks can improve system-wide financial stability while minimising the negative externalities of disruption and competition. These findings can help regulators, policymakers, academics, and practitioners understand the opportunities and challenges of emerging technologies in the banking industry. © 2022 by the authors.},

Since its advent, the Blockchain was inherently supposed to be used in combination with cryptocurrencies but currently this technology is being used in other areas as well. One particular area based on the distributed ledger technology that has grabbed the attention of many technologist and financial marketers is 'Smart Contracts'. Based on a cryptocurrency framework known as Ethereum, these smart contracts can be used for different applications such as Option Pricing, Currency Exchange, Revenue Management System, Crowd-funding and Peer-To-Peer networking. In our current effort, we have designed a smart contract and demonstrate that this smart contract could be used to take various possible positions in an European style option. We have analyzed the contract for potential security vulnerabilities when implemented in Blockchain. These option based smart contracts could be used for collateral contract services among finance industries. © 2018 IEEE.},

Financial physics, also known as Econophysics, has brought new statistical methods and insights into the studies. Since thermodynamic laws, one of the most frequently used simulation systems, can explain the basics of all physical movements, the crypto money market, the stock market, and the dynamics of the foreign exchange market have been introduced. Thermodynamics describes heat movements; explain internal energy of economic systems, heat and jobs created (also called wealth or profits), and open a new page in quantitative/qualitative Economic Research. In this study, following the second law of thermodynamics, the Carnot cycle was written with a new point of view from the question of whether the amount of work given to the system in the crypto currency reserve can explain the possible trading (exchange) prices that occur or are likely to occur with the exchange of money. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

However, while cryptocurrency is kept in smart contracts, such as being paid to a blockchain service, no extra profit is generated. The time value of cryptocurrency serves only as collateral, which is an issue of capital inefficiency. Therefore, we propose to maximize the time value of cryptocurrency in smart contracts by supplying it to decentralized money markets of Compound to earn supply interest. Furthermore, by utilizing the interest generated, we can mitigate the liquidity risk of Compound and thus do not diminish the flexibility of the original service much. Experiments are conducted to testify the proposed method, and the implementation cost is estimated to be 2.1 US dollars.

	doi = {10.1108/TCJ-08-2022-0140},
	abstract = {Research methodology: This case study is developed from secondary sources. Two types of data were used to develop this case. The statistical data are gathered from sources such as Yahoo! Finance, Trading Economics, Investing.com and The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey. Reports on market developments are gathered from major news outlets such as Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters. Case overview/synopsis: The year 2021 was a volatile year for the Turkish economy: it ended the year with 36\% annual inflation, 44\% currency devaluation, shortages of basic goods, street protests, etc. How does the Turkish currency crisis in 2021 play out in various financial markets such as the foreign exchange, bond, stock and cryptocurrency markets? This case study introduces students to Turkey’s economic crisis in 2021 and how the Turkish lira’s depreciation, home inflation and central bank policies interact to affect its various financial markets. In the bond market, a depreciated lira heightened the credit risk of Turkey’s bond issuers and effectively crippled the country’s bond market. In contrast, Turkey’s stock and cryptocurrency markets experienced a rally as Turks put their money into equities and cryptocurrencies to hedge against inflation. In international trade, the lira’s fall and the supply chain disruptions in Asia benefited Turkish exporters tremendously. In contrast, Turkish importers suffered. In the Turkish society, the impact of the currency and inflation crisis fell the hardest on ordinary folks, who saw the values of their wages and pension benefits erode. In times of hardship, socially responsible citizens helped the poor by anonymously paying for others’ unpaid bills. Complexity academic level: Given the multicomplexity of a currency crisis, this case would be valuable for finance/economics students to understand how a country’s currency crisis and its central bank policies interact to impact its various financial markets. This case is appropriate for courses in Markets and Institutions with a global or cultural learning objective. Learning Objectives: 1. Describe how the Turkish lira’s depreciation affected its various financial markets, such as foreign exchange, bond, stock and cryptocurrency markets.2. Understand the cultural perspective on usury, how it exists in modern-day finance, and its’ role in President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s economic policy.3. Compare and contrast Turkey’s export and import industries and how they are being affected by the lira’s depreciation.4. Evaluate the risk exposure of foreign investors who participate in Turkey’s stock market given a depreciating lira.5. Evaluate the creditworthiness of Turkish corporations who issued dollar- or euro-denominated bonds as well as issuers of lira-denominated bonds given a depreciating lira.6. Understand the social impacts of a currency crisis and the charitable acts of socially responsible citizens. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The risks and roadblocks in the path of Blockchain adoption in financial services will also be discussed. Need of the Study: Blockchain operates without any central authority. Instead, it could be understood as a transaction-containing ledger shared among many users. The adoption of Blockchain is gaining traction in every field, but still, a sense of doubt about its reliability can be observed among ordinary people. Thus, an investigation of the operational intricacies and technicalities could assist in clarifying the confusion associated with this technology. Methodology: To achieve the aims mentioned above, an exploratory research design involving a review of the secondary data linked with the implementation and impact of Blockchain technology in the domain of finance is conducted. Findings: The mode of operation of Blockchain technology is thoroughly explained, along with the influence it has exercised in the financial domain in recent years. Practical Implications: The findings of this study can mainly assist global investors and users worldwide by clarifying the concept and operations of Blockchain technology.

Specifically, the algorithm efficiently determines the optimal non-linear mapping and the corresponding lead–lag structure between two time series. Afterwards, this study explores the use of optimal causal paths as a means for identifying promising stock pairs and for generating buy and sell signals. For this purpose, the established trading strategy exploits information about the leading stock to predict future returns of the following stock. The value-add of the proposed framework is assessed by benchmarking it with variants relying on classic similarity measures and a buy-and-hold investment in the S\&P 500 index. In the empirical back-testing study, the trading algorithm generates statistically and economically significant returns of 54.98\% p.a. and an annualized Sharpe ratio of 3.57 after transaction costs. Returns are well superior to the benchmark approaches and do not load on any common sources of systematic risk. The strategy outperforms in the context of cryptocurrencies even in recent times due to the fact that stock returns contain substantial information about the future bitcoin returns. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

	doi = {10.1108/IJOEM-02-2022-0263},
	abstract = {Purpose: Research in the domain of behavioral finance has proven that investors demonstrate irrational behavior while making investment decisions. In a similar domain, the primary objective of this research is to prioritize the behavioral biases that influence cryptocurrency investors' investment decisions in the Indian context. Design/methodology/approach: A fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP) was used to prioritize the behavioral factors impacting cryptocurrency investors' investment decisions. Overconfidence and optimism, anchoring, representativeness, information availability, herding, regret aversion, and loss aversion are among the primary biases evaluated in the present study. Findings: The findings suggested that the two most important influential criteria were herding and regret aversion, with loss aversion and information availability being the least influential criteria. Opinions of family, friends, and colleagues about investment in cryptocurrency, the sale of cryptocurrencies that have increased in value, the avoidance of selling currencies that have decreased in value, the agony of holding losing cryptocurrencies for too long rather than selling winning cryptocurrencies too soon, and the purchase of cryptocurrencies that have fallen significantly from their all-time high are the most important sub-criteria. Research limitations/implications: This survey only covered active cryptocurrency participants. Additionally, the study was limited to individual crypto investors in one country, India, with a sample size of 467 participants. Although the sample size is appropriate, a larger sample size might reflect the more realistic scenario of the Indian crypto market. Practical implications: The study is relevant to individual and institutional cryptocurrency investors, crypto portfolio managers, policymakers, researchers, market regulators, and society at large. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, no prior research has attempted to explain how the overall importance of various criteria and sub-criteria related to behavioral factors that influence the decision-making process of crypto retail investors can be assessed and how the priority of focus can be established, particularly in the Indian context. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.137268},
	abstract = {When compared to traditional fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies represent a small, but growing, fraction of financial transactions. The rapid growth of cryptocurrencies has raised concerns regarding the environmental impact of this energy-intensive type of currency. In this study, water and carbon footprints associated with cryptocurrencies are assessed. These environmental footprints are then compared to the water and carbon footprints associated with conventional currencies, which is a novelty of this study. A spatially refined, bottom-up analysis of the most energy-intensive aspects of each financial system is used in the comparison of these systems. Specifically, the energy use for printing money, bank branches, automated teller machines (ATM), and cashless transactions is evaluated at the country level and compared to the energy use of crypto mining around the world. Cryptocurrencies’ electricity use of 236 × 106 megawatt hours (MWh) in 2021 surpassed that of the conventional transaction system, despite cryptocurrencies representing less than 0.5\% of global cashless financial transactions. In terms of its water footprint, cryptocurrencies have an annual water consumption of 3670 × 106 cubic meters (m3). Cryptocurrencies' water footprint is more than double that of conventional currencies because crypto mining takes place in countries with higher water intensities for electricity. Crypto mining activities are also estimated to result in almost 139 × 106 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) of global greenhouse gas emissions. While cryptocurrencies represent a small percentage of financial transactions, their environmental impact is much larger than the conventional financial transaction system. This study shows how regulatory changes, such as the 2021 crypto mining ban in China, and crypto mining location can have implications on the environmental footprint associated with cryptocurrency. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Stablecoin, as a specific type of cryptocurrency, is undoubtedly one of the underlying infrastructures that underpin the rapidly growing decentralised finance (Defi) ecosystem. It is regarded and used as the on-chain 'legal currency'. Questions arise as to is it such a low-volatility cryptocurrency really stable and is it able to always stay stable. The answers are probably no. Whether the underlying code is law is for debate, but it is not yet applicable to Defi and stablecoins. The law would undoubtedly play a positive role in improving the stability of stablecoin. Through this paper, we focus on the consumer protection aspect of stablecoin legislation and regulation. We set out to analyse the nature of stablecoins in a legal sense. We first survey the legislative practice of cryptocurrencies in multiple jurisdictions and extract proposals specifically for stablecoins for comparative analysis propose how to best regulate stablecoins. The definition of 'stable' is explored from three critical aspects: price stability, collateral stability and permissionless. Finally, we conclude by proposing a general legislative framework for stablecoins. We aim to contribute to the current state of stablecoin and provide insight for international principles for such regulation in the future. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Chapter 4 examines the development of cryptocurrency in the Australian context with special reference to regulatory response by the Australian legislator to the new developments in the digital-finance world. However, since cryptocurrencies have no national or geographical boundaries, it is essential that our discussion should not only confine to Australia. Hence, we place our discussion in the international context, while focusing more on the regulatory developments in the Australian context. The varying characteristics of crypto currencies, tokens, and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) make the legal nature of such very difficult to assess. The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) takes a broader approach and seeks into the fact whether a token falls within the definition of a financial product, with the term “security” with primarily referring to shares and debentures in Australia. Jurisdictions elsewhere take various approaches to regulate cryptocurrencies and associated entities. Countries such as China and South Korea have announced outright bans on ICOs. whereas other countries such as United States have issued regulatory warnings. This discussion does not intend to cover all aspects pertaining to cryptocurrencies, yet looks into some resent developments and how the Australian legislator is responding to the ever changing scenario. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.},

	title = {Blockchain–industrial applications and potentials},
	abstract = {The blockchain technology has become well known in the finance sector, for instance as the basis for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. To go beyond its mere use as cryptocurrency, academia and practice expect large potentials by its application in further, particularly industrial, sectors. One reason is that, being a decentralized and transparent electronic register managed remotely by subscribers on a distributed network, blockchain creates trust in online transactions due to its reliability and safety. These are indispensable functionalities for business process digitization. Despite blockchain’s expected far-reaching economic potential, and its relevance for academia and corporate practice alike, possible industrial application fields are still relatively unknown. Hence, our research question is: Which are the potentials of the blockchain technology in an industrial context? Our study’s main goal is to analyze this technology’s industrial applications and elaborate on its future potentials. To address the research question at hand, we employ a systematic literature review. By doing so we identify, evaluate, synthesize, and summarize all relevant scientific publications, which allows us to detect the current state of research concerning industrial applications and potentials of the blockchain technology. To ensure that the results are reliable and comprehensible, our literature review is based on previously established, unambiguous, and repeatable steps: During its course, we search the databases ScienceDirect, Ebsco, Google Scholar, and ABI/Inform for scientific publications from 2008 until today. These databases are well established in management research and constitute a source of high-quality information. Applying several criteria, such as quality, rigor, and scope, we select 59 relevant papers, which we examine, synthesize, and eventually discuss in detail. By displaying the current state of research on blockchain’s industrial application fields, we develop six dominant research categories: Motivations for using a blockchain, opportunities for IIoT applications, obstacles to implementation, approaches to implementing a blockchain, impact of blockchain technology on the business model, and examples of blockchain applications. We elaborate further on two case examples to illustrate how industrial companies implement blockchain effectively. By doing so, we provide a broad overview on blockchain’s industrial applications and give detailed insights into the potentials this technology comprises within this context. Our study provides both researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of blockchain’s implications for industrial value creation. With this, we enable managers to draw targeted conclusions on the value of applying the technology and to take adequate decisions regarding its effective management. As our literature review is among the first to synthesize recent research findings on the industrial potentials of blockchain, we contribute to the academic debate. By identifying further research fields and in particular by providing future research implications, we lay the fundament for further studies. © IAMOT 2019.},

The paper summarizes the research and findings in this emerging field. Thereafter, it identifies the gaps and provides directions for further research. Simultaneously, the paper collates technical terms related to FinTech that appear repeatedly in each category and explains them. Finally, the study highlights the lessons that growing FinTech firms and their regulators can learn from the experiences of their counterparts across the globe. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review of literature consisting of 130 studies (social science research network [SSRN]-29 papers, Scopus-81, other sources-20) on FinTech is carried out in this thematic paper. Findings: This thematic paper divides FinTech into three themes, i.e. financial industry, innovation/technology and law/regulation. The paper suggests that a thorough impact of FinTech on various stakeholders can be understood using three dimensions, namely, consumers, market players and regulatory front. It is noted that FinTech is in its nascent phase and is undergoing continuous development and implementation through product and process innovation, disruption and transformation. Research limitations/implications: The paper reports that FinTech promises huge potential for further study by various stakeholders in the FinTech industry – from academia to practitioners to regulators. Practical implications: The paper summarizes lessons that could be of significance for FinTech users, producers, entrepreneurs, investors, policy designers and regulators.

	abstract = {Purpose: While Blockchain can serve us, Bitcoin threatens our survival. If Bitcoin is assumed to be a country, it will rank 38th globally for energy consumption. With 90.2 metric million tonnes of carbon dioxide, Bitcoin mining and trading has emerged as an environmental threat. The current study investigates how the trading-specific variables, the prices of Crypto Index and Ethereum, affect bitcoin-based energy consumption. Also, the role of mining-specific variables is analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses monthly data from various sources collected from December 2018 to January 2023. The authors used the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Model to determine the short- and long-term relationships between variables. This study uses the Theory of Green Marketing and the Theory of Cross Elasticity of Demand as a theoretical lens. Findings: The findings show that escalating crypto market index and Ethereum prices with a one-month lag increases bitcoin-specific electricity consumption and carbon emissions. Green investors may shift to cryptocurrencies based on consensus other than of Proof-of-Work. Ethereum behaves like a substitute for Bitcoin, reflected by the long-term positive relationship between Bitcoin's energy consumption and Ethereum prices. Originality/value: The study analyses how the crypto market index and Ethereum price affect bitcoin-based energy use. The relationships identified are substantiated by the literature to provide suggestions to green investors and policymakers to mitigate the harmful impact of Bitcoin's colossal energy consumption on the natural environment. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {We analyse the determinants of success for 630 ICOs undertaken from August 2015 up until the end of December 2017, a period in which the market for ICOs grew to an unprecented level. We find evidence that ICOs are more successful in raising funding when they disclose more information to investors (i.e. have a higher profile rating), have a higher quality rating by cryptocurrency experts, have a pre-ICO GitHub repository, organise a presale, refrain from offering bonus schemes, have shorter planned token sale durations and have a larger project team. ICOs that disclose more information to investors and that have a higher quality rating at the time of the campaign show stronger ex-post performance. Longer-term project success is positively impacted by having a pre-ICO GitHub repository, a shorter planned token sale duration and having a larger project team at the time of the ICO, although these results depend on the ex-post success measure used. We conclude that for entrepreneurs it is important to make an ICO as transparent as possible and that profile and expert ratings are a valuable means to overcome the information asymmetry problems associated with token sales. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

In contrast to traditional financial systems and centralized crypto-exchanges, HTLC protocols provide a method to trade crypto-currencies in a peer-to-peer manner. However, considering the elimination of a third-party authority, remarkable price fluctuations and the protocol's extensive time-to-completion, involved parties might be incentivized to deviate from the protocol and cancel a trade midway. Thus, this paper analyzes the protocol's incentive structure based on a model of rationality to further quantify its impact on potential trades, using historical exchange rates. By analyzing different crypto-currency trading pairs, this paper highlights the probabilistic nature of a typical HTLC protocol. The results show that although the protocol does not offer a guarantee for a successful trade, it is applicable in scenarios of exchange-rates with low drift, low volatility, and an optimized time-to-completion. © 2020 IEEE.},

Design/methodology/approach: The study employs time-varying parameter vector autoregression and Quantile regression methods to understand the impact of events on traditional and upcoming asset classes. To further understand the connectedness of assets under consideration, the study used Geo-Political Risk Index (GPR) and Global Economic Policy and Uncertainty index (GPEU). Findings: Findings show that these markets are strongly linked, which will only expand in the post-pandemic future. Before the pandemic, the MSCI World and Emerging Markets indices contributed the most shocks to the remaining market variables. Green bond index shows a greater correlation and shock transmission with gold. Bitcoin can no longer be used as a good hedging instrument, validating the fact that the 21st-century technology assets. The results further opine that under extreme economic consequences with high GPR and GPEU, even gold cannot be considered a safe investment asset. Originality/value: Financial markets and the players who administer and communicate their investment logics are heavily reliant on conventional asset classes such as oil, gas, coal, nuclear and allied groupings, but these emerging asset classes are attempting to diversify. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Multivariate time series prediction is one of the main challenges and has been widely studied in quantitative finance. Prediction outcomes are the prerequisites for active portfolio construction and optimization and play a significant role in developing an efficient trading strategy. Since inception, cryptocurrencies have broad market acceptance and constitute an asset class characterised by high returns, high volatilities, usage, transaction speed and low correlations. Many hedge fund managers, proprietary trading desk in large banks and boutique trading firms has spent considerable efforts in forecasting cryptocurrency prices. This study is about the portfolio construction of nine most capitalised cryptocurrencies: binancecoin, bitcoin, bitcoincash, chainlink, EOS, ETH, Litecoin, MCO and XRP (More details on cryptocurrencies and the market capitalization can be seen in any crypto currency exchanges like binance, Upbit, Bitfinex, Coinbase). ARIMA, convolutional neural network and long short-term memory methods are proposed to forecast the cryptocurrency prices. In addition, multiple portfolios are constructed using equal weighted portfolio, modern portfolio theory, cointegrated pairs, Kelly criterion and risk parity which make financial or economic sense and then portfolio performance measures are used thereby determining the best portfolio to hold. We find that the portfolio constructed using cointegrated pair has outperformed and the annualised returns are further maximised using a pair trading strategy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	title = {The bitcoin dilemma: {Weighing} the economic and environmental costs and benefits},
	abstract = {There are few innovations that have the potential to revolutionize commerce and have evolved so quickly that there remain significant misunderstandings about their operation, opportunity, and challenges as has Bitcoin in the dozen years since its invention. The potential for banking, transacting, and public recording of important records is profound, but can be displacing if not done with appropriate care, and is downright dangerous if certain pitfalls are not noted and avoided. Among other things, this book proves the existence of a Bitcoin dilemma that challenges the conventional wisdom which mistakenly asserts the incredibly intensive energy consumption in Proof-of-Work cryptocurrency mining will be remedied by more efficient mining machines or sustainable power sources. It shows for the first time within a well-specified economic model of Bitcoin mining that the recent runup in electricity consumption has a simple and inevitable explanation. For a coin with almost completely inelastic supply and steadily increasing demand, the conditions for accelerating electricity demand is consistent with economic theory and may well characterize the future of Bitcoin. The book also demonstrates the counterintuitive result that improvements in mining efficiency, in terms of electricity consumption per terahash of processing power, or decreases in electricity costs as cheaper sustainable energy is diverted to this industry, merely exacerbates the acceleration of energy consumption because of a prisoner’s dilemma arms-race-to-the-bottom. The book proposes policy solutions to mitigate this Bitcoin dilemma but note that the mobility of industry capacity which needs but a ready supply of electricity and an Internet connection frustrates local regulation and warrants global solutions. The incredible opportunities of this industry will only be realized if our regulators, legislators, entrepreneurs, and general public garner a more complete and objective understanding of this and other Proof-of-Work mining techniques. The book provides this broader perspective based on the author’s research as an economist, his position as a director of a large regional bank, his understanding as a technologist and as an environmental and sustainability researcher, and his public policy experience as a mayor who has also written books and articles about public policy and public finance. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	title = {Taxation of the {Bitcoin}: initial insights through a correspondence analysis},
	volume = {26},
	doi = {10.1108/MEDAR-10-2017-0229},
	abstract = {Purpose: The Bitcoin has experienced wide popularity in academic and commercial spheres during the years following 2012. Research has been conducted in respect of information technology, finance and reporting paradigms, but there has been little research into the taxation of the Bitcoin. The purpose of this paper is to present a conceptual approach for developing a taxation policy for the Bitcoin, using a multi-jurisdictional analysis. Design/methodology/approach: An interpretive mixed-method approach is followed. The traits of the Bitcoin are determined through a review of the literature, followed by the determination of key taxation themes using a multi-jurisdictional view where the jurisdictions were determined using the largest Bitcoin exchanges. These form the row and column headings of the correspondence table research instrument, respectively. The correspondence table was completed by 40 tax experts. Correspondence analysis (a multivariate statistical technique) was then used to determine correlations between the Bitcoin traits and taxation themes, further used to present initial insights into developing a taxation policy for the Bitcoin. Findings: The correspondence analysis reveals that, contrary to current tax laws, the manner of acquisition as opposed to the reason (intention) for acquisition is key in determining how the Bitcoin is to be taxed. For taxing purposes, Bitcoin is seen as being distinct from currency, given that transactions with the Bitcoin are seen as barter transactions. Finally, because of the unique characteristics of the Bitcoin, it is shown that exchanges and the Bitcoin need to be regulated in the same manner as a currency. Research limitations/implications: This research focuses on income tax including capital gains tax and consumption taxes and was conducted with a sample of purposefully selected South African tax experts, given that the Bitcoin is experiencing enhanced popularity in South Africa. As a result, this research does not provide generalisable positivist conclusions and does not purport to represent the views of all tax practitioners. This paper does, however, provide an initial mechanism to develop taxation treatments for transactions not covered by existing legislation. Originality/value: This paper is the first to provide normative recommendations on the taxation of the Bitcoin. Using correspondence analysis, this paper offers an innovative approach for developing taxation policies when a transaction is not specifically included in the extant legislation. Further value is added through the use of a third dimension in the correspondence analysis which enhances the exploratory potential of the research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	title = {Bitcoin as a new asset class},
	volume = {27},
	doi = {10.1108/MEDAR-11-2017-0241},
	abstract = {Purpose: Bitcoin is the best-known cryptocurrency which currently holds the largest market capitalisation and is regarded as a standard example of a cryptocurrency. There is, however, no consensus as to the nature of the Bitcoin. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether Bitcoin represents a new asset class by building on prior research. Design/methodology/approach: The prior literature on asset classes is explored in detail and then applied to the Bitcoin. Four key criteria of asset classes are discussed, namely, investability, politico-economic profile, correlation of returns and risk-reward profile. Statistical techniques are used to inform the conclusions for the third and fourth criteria. Findings: This research finds that the Bitcoin represents a distinct alternative investment and asset class. There are significant opportunities for investment. The politico-economic profile of the decentralised and consensus-based Bitcoin is dissimilar to other asset classes. The Bitcoin shares little or no correlation with other asset classes. Using Sharpe Ratios, it is shown that the Bitcoin provides risk-adjusted returns over and above most asset classes. Research limitations/implications: The aim of this research is to present a normative exploration into the asset class nature of the Bitcoin and, as a result, the aim is not to create positivist generalisable conclusions. This paper does not address cryptocurrencies, other than Bitcoin and does not constitute a detailed manual on modern portfolio theory. Originality/value: This research adds to finance paradigm research on the Bitcoin by including a developing country perspective on Bitcoin as an asset class as prior studies have concentrated on developed country settings. Further, this research introduces recent economic data (2014 to 2017) in the form of daily observations to enhance prior understanding. It is important to understand if the Bitcoin represents an alternative investment and new asset class as this may affect investment decisions. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	title = {Law and practice of crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending in australia, china and japan},
	abstract = {The revolution in financial technology (FinTech) has created many advancements in the lending and investment space across the world. Law and Practice of Crowdfunding and Peer-to-Peer Lending in Australia, China, and Japan is a timely publication as FinTech grows up and moved into the mainstream of finance in the last decade. Financial services is a highly regulated industry as it is the lifeblood of a modern economy. Pelma Rajapakse, Hatsuru Morita, and Yinxu Huang have done very solid work blazing a new trail in what is a new industry and how to regulate it properly instead of stifling innovation. They have carried out a deep exploration and a thorough compilation of research that will bring everyone up to date on what Australia, China, and Japan are planning and doing in the field of crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending. In addition to peer-to-peer lending, the book focuses on laws and practices related to Central Bank digital currencies, cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) which is very meaningful and forward-looking. The authors presented their thoughts in such clarity that, even those who lack familiarity with Asia-Pacific, will see how FinTech was growing in various ways driven by different factors. For example, peer-to-peer lending in Japan is mostly for small and medium enterprises. It was popular in China but cracked down by the authorities for a few years. It provides an alternative fundraising channel for the capital market in Australia. We also see a set of regulatory approaches among jurisdictions. Some countries draft new regulations, while others amend existing laws. The mechanism of the regulatory sandbox was introduced. As we know, one size does not fit all. What kind of best practices or lessons learned can we apply to our own jurisdiction? This book covers all available answers to date.

	abstract = {Regulation of digital currency is still at its infancy as authorities around the world grapple with its mechanics, and study its impact and the best method to regulate it. Significant increase in the use of digital cryptocurrency based on Blockchain technology post-Bitcoin phenomenon had challenged the conventional idea of central bank monopoly in currency issuance. This had also raised concern that digital currency being used as an instrumentality of crime given its anonymity feature that allows for the flow of funds without tracing and the fact that it is built on trustless system that provides security of transaction. This concern, plus other consideration including the prospect of issuing central bank digital currency, had driven some authorities around the world to adopt countermeasures either via an outright ban or a regulatory regime that suits the nature of digital currency, which is purely virtual and anonymous. However, in coming out with an appropriate legal regime, authorities faced multiple difficulties especially when the pace of legal development does not sync congruently with the rapid progress of technology. In addition, given the growing prominence of Islamic finance around the world, questions also arise pertaining to the legality of digital cryptocurrency from the Islamic perspective. Through a qualitative study of relevant literatures as well as legislations in different countries, this chapter discusses the various categories of digital currency, its position from the Islamic perspective, regulatory regimes of digital cryptocurrency in selected jurisdictions and challenges faced by authorities around the world in regulating this new medium of exchange. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

	abstract = {Purpose: The paper aims to review the academic research work done in the area of Islamic financial technology. The Islamic FinTech area has been classified into three broad categories of the Islamic FinTech, Islamic Financial technology opportunities and challenges, Cryptocurrency/Blockchain sharia compliance and law/regulation. Finally, the study identifies and highlights the opportunities and challenges that Islamic Financial institutions can learn from the conventional FinTech organization across the world. Approach/Methodology/Design: The study collected 133 research studies (50 from Social Science Research Network (SSRN), 30 from Research gate, 33 from Google Scholar and 20 from other sources) in the area of Islamic Financial Technology. The study presents the systematic review of the above studies. Findings: The study classifies the Islamic FinTech into three broad categories namely, Islamic FinTech opportunities and challenges, Cryptocurrency/Blockchain sharia compliance and law/regulation. The study identifies that the sharia compliance related to the cryptocurrency/Blockchain is the biggest challenge which Islamic FinTech organizations are facing. During our review we also find that Islamic FinTech organizations are to be considered as partners by the Islamic Financial Institutions (IFI's) than the competitors. If Islamic Financial institutions want to increase efficiency, transparency and customer satisfaction they have to adopt FinTech and become partners with the FinTech companies. Practical Implications: The study will contribute positively to the understanding of Islamic Fintech for the academia, industry, regulators, investors and other FinTech users. Originality/Value: The study believes to contribute positively to understanding of Fintech based technology like cryptocurrency/Blockchain from sharia perspective. © 2020 International Strategic Management Association.

	doi = {10.20542/0131-2227-2022-66-6-35-43},
	abstract = {Currently, some countries are testing Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC). In February 2022 the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) launched its own pilot project of the digital Rouble. According to the CBR’s concept the digital Rouble’s platform (DRP) may be the first step to improvement of trans-border payments/ settlements including its potential integration with CBDC platforms of other countries. The author analyses the CBR’s concept and financial statistics to answer the question: can the digital Rouble increase usage of the Russian currency worldwide? Currently the Rouble is mainly used in trade settlements of Russia with Belarus (the share of the Rouble is 81 per cent) and Kazakhstan (62 per cent). In 2014 financial sanctions were imposed on Russia and the US Dollar transactions became unavailable for certain businesses. Since that moment the Russian Government made a lot of efforts to increase usage of the Rouble in foreign trade settlements, but the success was marginal. In general, the share of Rouble has increased, but it has seriously grown only in settlements for Russian exports to India – ​from 1.1 per cent in 2013 to 57.8 per cent in 2021. Despite Russia has an open financial account there is a number of obstacles for wider usage of the Rouble worldwide and they are as follows: Russia exports mainly raw materials, whose prices are denominated in the US Dollars; though last years the Russian government mainly borrowed in Roubles still at any convenient case it also borrows in other currencies; Russia has a big sovereign fund (over 10 per cent of its GDP), which is invested in non-Rouble papers; it is not rare happened that the state officials in public speeches advocate depreciation of the Rouble. Cumulatively the above mentioned issues lessen confidence in the Rouble and consequently decrease demand for it and its liquidity. Will the digital Rouble be immune to all of this? The author analysed its features and did not find anything that might help to overcome the abovementioned obstacles. There is also no evidence that the Russian Government may change its policy regarding the sovereign fund and other obstacles. Also, another serious threat for the digital Rouble may come from a new concept of the Russian Ministry of Finance, which advocates very soon inclusion of the cryptocurrency industry (CI) into the Russian financial system. Various countries, upon widening their experiments with the CBDC, begin to realise that the CI is a real threat to the CBDC. China is the first who has understood that there is a choice: either the CBDC or the CI, but not both. The CI already functions worldwide on a range of highly sophisticated and secure digital platforms. They cannot be really regulated by any country, though some governments have illusion that they can do this. The CBDC platforms will provide only in-country transactions at initial stage and connection between various CBDC platforms is a question yet. The CI platforms already operate globally and also give their users big anonymity, while this feature is something that the CBDC projects intend to exclude. Additional problem for Russia is that, given the low level of the Rouble internationalisation, in case the cryptocurrency industry would be legalised here, so this gives to local users much more interesting and developed instrument that yet to became feasible local digital currency. That’s why the author doubts that the digital Rouble will substantially increase the international role of the Russian currency in the near future. © 2022, Russian Academy of Sciences.

DeFi is a novel disruptive process that promotes the use of blockchain technology for creating and issuing all kinds of financial products and services. This study aimed to measure the relationship amongst the returns of DeFi tokens, other traditional assets, and user-generated content. While the relationship between other crypto assets and traditional assets has been researched, this has not been done on DeFi assets. This study uses a logit-probit model over a database comprising the daily returns of 13 DeFi, VIX, S\&P GSCI Crude Oil Index, and S\&P GSCI Gold Index, and the daily variation in DeFi mentions in Telegram chats and Twitter. The results show that all variables except the S\&P GSCI crude oil index returns and the daily variation in Twitter mentions were significant. This suggests that DeFi acts, similar to other crypto assets, as a safe haven.

Presenting the latest empirical and theoretical advances, it helps readers gain a better understanding of financial markets and cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to use a peer-to-peer network to prevent double-spending and to control its issue without the need for a central authority, and it has attracted wide public attention since its introduction. In recent years, the academic community has also started gaining interest in cyptocurrencies, and research in the field has grown rapidly. This book presents is a collection of the latest work on cryptocurrency markets and the properties of those markets. This book will appeal to graduate students and researchers from disciplines such as finance, economics, financial engineering, computer science, physics and applied mathematics working in the field of financial markets, including cryptocurrency markets. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.},

	abstract = {Over the past two years, financial markets have been heavily affected by central banks’ unconventional monetary policies, in particular quantitative easing (QE). Accommodative monetary policies have also brought interest rates down to zero and/or negative territory as a mean to stimulate business investments. The recent rise of cryptocurrencies (The terms cryptocurrencies and crypto assets are used interchangeably.) poses, in turn, urgent challenges to central banks’ efforts to face the multiple pandemic-driven unprecedented consequences. Private currencies may lead to a relatively cashless society, thereby threatening central bank monopoly of issuance, a situation in which businesses, households and financial markets could lose access to risk-free central bank money. In addition, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) promises to transform the traditional financial system into an open, permission-less and autonomous financial system. The present paper discusses the rise of digital payments across the euro area, the spread of cryptocurrency trading and the intention of the European Central Bank (ECB) to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC). We provide evidence on the existence of cointegration between selected cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and traditional financial assets. Both the rise of digital payments and the increased popularity of cryptocurrencies can be seen as the main drivers behind the prospective issuance of the digital euro, significantly affecting financial markets and business models alike. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Associazione Amici di Economia e Politica Industriale.},

	abstract = {The price volatility of cryptocurrencies is often cited as a major hindrance to their wide-scale adoption. Consequently, during the last two years, multiple so called stablecoins have surfaced - cryptocurrencies focused on maintaining stable exchange rates. In this paper, we systematically explore and analyze the stablecoin landscape. Based on a survey of 24 specific stablecoin projects, we go beyond individual coins for extracting general concepts and approaches. We combine our findings with learnings from classical monetary policy, resulting in a comprehensive taxonomy of cryptocurrency stabilization. We use our taxonomy to highlight the current state of development from different perspectives and show blank spots. For instance, while over 91\% of projects promote 1-to-1 stabilization targets to external assets, monetary policy literature suggests that the smoothing of short term volatility is often a more sustainable alternative. Our taxonomy bridges computer science and economics, fostering the transfer of expertise. For example, we find that 38\% of the reviewed projects use a combination of exchange rate targeting and specific stabilization techniques that can render them vulnerable to speculative economic attacks - an avoidable design flaw. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Complementing increasing concerns that cryptocurrency could be used to finance terror networks, in this paper we investigate the effect of monthly terrorist attacks outcomes–success, injuries, and fatalities–on monthly returns of 1,178 cryptocurrencies representing 18,016 cryptocurrency-year-months between 2014 and 2018. The monthly percentage of successful terror attacks Granger causes the monthly cryptocurrency returns and lowers the monthly cryptocurrency returns. Increasing success in terror attacks is negatively associated with cryptocurrency returns, the count of wounded is negatively associated with cryptocurrency returns, however, the count of dead is positively associated with cryptocurrency returns. The success in terror attacks has the largest effect on returns, relative to the count of wounded and dead. The estimates are consistent when controlling for cross-sectional correlation among major cryptocurrencies, and cryptocurrencies could be a weak hedge against successful terrorist attacks. The findings are robust to cryptocurrencies in the top three quartiles of the market capitalization and the mediation analysis shows that terror attacks lower returns through the decline in the short-term macroeconomic cycle. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

	volume = {50},
	abstract = {Decentralized finance (DeFi) represents a specific application of crypto-asset technology that has made significant advancements in adoption. While academic tax literature has focused on basic crypto-asset transactions, the tax consequences of DeFi transactions have been much less frequently explored. This study considers whether income or expenditure arising in specific DeFi transactions might be classified as interest in terms of South African income tax legislation as well as within the international tax context. Classification as interest has significant implications. Within South African domestic legislation, it impacts the determination of source, quantification of amounts, timing of recognition, application of exemptions, and imposition of withholding tax. Internationally, it has implications for the determination of jurisdictional taxing rights under double tax agreements. This study proposes that, while historically, interest may have been thought of exclusively as arising in the context of monetary debt, this is not a definitive characteristic of interest. Rather, interest represents remuneration for the provision of capital in the form of a loan principal with a contractual right to repayment. Whether each of these elements is present in the cases of the identified DeFi transactions is inconclusive. The study therefore recommends the provision of guidance to taxpayers by South Africa and other jurisdictions, and supports a coordinated approach among jurisdictions in the determination of income tax outcomes © 2022.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a solution to the transfer problem between blockchain-based heterogeneous cryptocurrencies and CBDCs, with research derived from an analysis of the existing literature. Interoperability between heterogeneous blockchains has been an obstacle to service diversity and user convenience. Many types of cryptocurrencies are currently trading on the market, and many countries are researching and testing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). In this paper, existing interoperability studies and solutions between heterogeneous blockchains and differences from the proposed service model are described. To enhance digital financial services and improve user convenience, transfer between heterogeneous cryptocurrencies, transfer between heterogeneous CBDCs, and transfer between cryptocurrency and CBDC should be required. This paper proposes an interoperable architecture between heterogeneous blockchains, and a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) service model based on the interoperable architecture for transferring between blockchain-based heterogeneous cryptocurrencies and CBDCs. Security threats to the proposed service model are identified and security requirements to prevent the identified security threats are specified.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to thoroughly review studies that have used blockchain technology in financial services. This study will help provide a holistic framework that would highlight the current state and challenges of the blockchain in the financial services sector. Design/methodology/approach: The objective of this study is to systematically examine and organize the current body of research literature that either quantitatively or qualitatively explored the use of blockchain technology in financial services. The study uses PRISMA-guided systematic review along with bibliometric analysis to achieve the purpose. Findings: This study contributes to the existing literature by exploring and analyzing systematic studies available on blockchain with special reference to financial services sector. With blockchain based on five principles, namely, computational logic, peer-to-peer transmission, irreversibility of records, distributed database and transparency with pseudonym has immense potential to unleash and transform the financial service industry. With increasing blockchain-based operations of decentralized banking, insurance, trade finance, financial markets and cryptocurrency market, the subject is rapidly growing and seeking considerable contribution from scholars from around the world. Research limitations/implications: This study uses systematic literature review approach, which has its own demerits. Like other studies based on Systematic Literature Review, this study also suffers from a certain bias such as sample selection bias, publication bias, data interpretation and the combination of quantitative and qualitative studies in the population. Further, the adoption and resultant benefits of blockchain have not been empirically tested. Practical implications: This study can help policymakers and institutions in determining their future course of action, as it highlights the state of research in the area of blockchain technology and financial services.

	abstract = {This paper examines Bitcoin from a legal and regulatory perspective, answering several important questions. Bitcoin has been the focus of the forums for the past few years by causing a whirlwind of arguments in a various number of fields all over the globe, such as finance, technology and most importantly the legal field. Currency's evolution through time has been steady and sturdy, but after the creation of crypto currencies, the whole ground structure of a traditional currency has been shattered and transformed dramatically thus changing the core qualities of currencies with its intangibility, anonymity and decentralized nature which are considered as the main merits of Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency. But on second thought, these benefits arose huge complications on both the legal and financial surface where illegal activities from criminals and drug addicts take place by using Bitcoins as a currency, such as fraud, money laundering and terror finance. On the other hand, lack of trust among individuals and merchants in Bitcoin users is the prime factor leading to theft. Nations around the world started to work on defining the nature of Bitcoin in order to regulate crypto currencies in general with a sound legal framework because with great power comes great responsibility to protect citizens from the risks accompanying Bitcoin. The focus of the paper is to cover positive aspects of Bitcoin as a currency and mainly the controversy circling around Bitcoin's regulations. The focus of this paper is to examine legal and technical issues and current international legal status regarding Bitcoin as a crypto currency and recent legal developments affecting Bitcoin, based upon their actual use. © 2019 Journal of Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to gain some insight into central bank digital currency research by reviewing the recent advances in central bank digital currency (CBDC) research in a way that would help researchers, policy makers and practitioners to take a closer look at CBDC. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a systematic literature review methodology. Findings: The review shows a general consensus that a CBDC is a liability of the central bank and it has cash-like attributes. The review also presents the motivation and benefits of issuing a CBDC such as the need to increase financial inclusion, the need to improve the conduct of monetary policy and to foster efficient digital payments. The review also shows that many central banks are researching the potential to issue CBDCs due to its many benefits. However, a number of studies have called for caution against over-optimism about the potential benefits of CBDC due to the limiting nature of CBDC design and its inability to meet multiple competing goals. Suggested areas for future research are identified such as the need to find the optimal CBDC design that meets all competing objectives, the need for empirical evidence on the effect of CBDC on the cost of credit and financial stability, and the need to find a balance between limiting the CBDC holdings of users and allowing users to hold as much CBDC as they want, and there is a need to undertake country-specific and regional case studies of CBDC design.

	title = {Audit and accounting considerations on cryptoassets and related transactions},
	volume = {184},
	doi = {10.21003/EA.V184-11},
	abstract = {Introduction. The rapid rise and volatility of cryptoassets have led to increased global interest by governments, investors, regulators. In 2020, the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies increased to USD 758.06 billion by expert estimations. Each of the cryptoassets has its own unique features and characteristics which makes their accounting and auditing challenging. The lack of official accounting and auditing guidance for cryptoassets and related transactions impose additional audit risks that should be measured properly before the client-acceptance stage and planning audit procedures. We developed a model which links financial statement assertions, identified cryptoassets' risks that should be considered during the audit, and related controls in response to such risks. The purpose of this paper is to identify cryptoassets framework for audit planning and gathering audit evidence to support management assertions regarding their financial statements. Methods. This paper adopts an empirical research approach with application of auditing and analytical procedures. In a comprehensive analytical overview of trends in cryptoassets market capitalization, the authors have used statistical methods and structural analysis, the selected sample includes daily data of cryptoassets market capitalization during January 2016 - February 2020. Results. According to the conducted research, the auditors have to consider whether to accept or continue an audit engagement when an entity has engaged in material cryptocurrency transactions; the auditors have to identify and assess risks of material misstatement in financial statements related to cryptoassets transactions and balances. We suggested a possible substantive audit procedures for cryptoassets and related transactions, such as: inspection of the wallets and verification the balances on them; confirmation by a third party (traders); inspection of documents supporting ownership of the asset (white papers, agreements with crypto-traders); testing client internal controls system and controls that are implemented to ensure the security of the private key of crypto-wallet. Conclusions. It is becoming common for financial statements to show cryptoassets balances and reflect the results of cryptoassets transactions, however, many auditors may have little or no experience with cryptoassets and therefore may not fully appreciate the challenges that auditing these items may present. The auditors need to identify and assess risks of material misstatement throughout the process of obtaining an understanding of the entity and its control environment, and evaluate the potential effect of that risks on financial statements. © 2020 Institute of Society Transformation.

	abstract = {Newer and better ways of financing lubricates the wheels of an economy. In recent years, there have been phenomenal changes in technologies used in finance. One of such technologies was introduced by creating the first cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The technology behind this invention is known as blockchain. Although there are and there might be other use cases of blockchain technology, the finance era is important and currently it is the most adapted industry; currently there are a number of cryptocurrencies, tokens, smart contract applications among others. This article seeks to introduce the basics of—so called—decentralized finance (DeFi) through an exploration of blockchain technology in the field of finance. The focus is on the definition of decentralized finance, its elements, its current state and its future. Elimination of intermediary need, easier access, improved inclusiveness, and transaction speed, flexibility to write any contract that can be codable, immutability of transactions, better interoperability and censorship resistance are some of the main advantages of blockchain. Additionally, increased privacy, transparency, enhanced security, efficiency in the form of reduction in overhead costs for banks, and trust are considered as the benefits of blockchain technology in finance, hence for DeFi. Its power need due to the excessive computer power needs, setting standards in validating new blocks and in communicating between different networks are important issues. Besides, user experience, scalability, current speed of blockchain networks, regulations like AML and KYC requirements, the lack of regulation in DeFi, and interoperability are key issues as well. In summary, the current state of DeFi markets is not technologically able to provide a worldwide service at the scale the centralized finance provides. It needs improvements in its technology and sound regulations to gain wide acceptance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

These innovations facilitate the delivery of financial services using smart contracts. DeFi encompasses all financial services that are built on public block-chains, based on open protocols and removes intermediaries from the financial intermediation process. There is significant cryptocurrency activity in Africa while DeFi developments are relatively new and unpopular in the African con-tinent. This chapter introduces DeFi in Africa. It presents some statistics and data on DeFi in Africa. Thereafter, the potential benefits, challenges and regulatory issues associated with DeFi in Africa are presented. Method: This study used literature reviews and external data sources to show the benefits and advantages of DeFi. Findings: The findings show that there is low interest in DeFi in Africa. Some benefits of DeFi to African countries include increased liquidity for many small-and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs), new opportunities to raise additional capital to fund capital-intensive activities, usher in an era of smart contracts that are negotiated bilaterally without needing an intermediary, encourage peer-to-peer trade between economic agents in several African countries, enhance the efficiency of the Pan-African Payment Settlement System and encourage more trade between individuals and corporations under the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, among others.

	title = {The cryptocurrency phenomenon: {The} origins, evolution and economics of digital currencies},
	abstract = {This book provides a comprehensive analysis of the cryptocurrency phenomenon from a financial/monetary point of view. It offers a unique slant in at least two ways, with the financial perspective as the reference point. An examination of the technicalities surrounding blockchain and the mining of cryptocurrencies is included, but the reading is oriented to those who seek to better understand how these technical issues help to explain the functioning and the potential of cryptocurrencies, without touching on coding aspects. Moreover, the book addresses cryptocurrencies as an evolution of the concept of money, and it frames the analysis to give readers all the knowledge needed to connect the cryptocurrency phenomenon with traditional monetary theories. In so doing, cryptocurrencies are not considered as a completely disconnected trend, set apart from traditional financial systems, but as innovations that will push the concept of money forward, without dismantling previous foundations. The book also includes a discussion on central banks, and stresses how their initial diffidence toward cryptocurrencies has turned into a more active approach that includes projects to develop the so-called Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC), thereby completing the analysis of the state of the art of the cryptocurrency surge. The mix of theoretical content on the concept of money, the description of payment tools and the functioning of the payment industry, and the analysis of blockchain and the cryptocurrency markets makes the book interesting reading for researchers, scholars and students of economics, finance, or business, enabling them to develop the ability to understand the dynamics of the cryptocurrency phenomenon and its possible evolution. © 2024 Gianni Nicolini and Silvia Intini.},

	doi = {10.1108/JFC-12-2022-0299},
	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to explore factors influencing Vietnamese people’s susceptibility to fraud through cryptocurrency Ponzi schemes. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the gullibility theory, the theory of planned behavior theory, the traditional theory of finance and the theory of financial behavior, to develop a questionnaire which is then sent to respondents who are Vietnamese individuals. Subsequently, the partial least squares structural equation modeling approach (PLS-SEM) is used to analyze 370 collected responses. Findings: This research shows the important roles that trust, risk appetite and knowledge of Ponzi play in respect of fraud susceptibility, among which trust has the highest positive impact. Moreover, there is no evidence of relationships between Vietnamese people’s susceptibility to fraud via cryptocurrency Ponzi schemes and attitudes toward investment scams, knowledge of investment or knowledge of Ponzi schemes. Research limitations/implications: This paper collects only 370 valid responses, which raises some questions regarding the diversity and representativeness of the survey sample. Practical implications: This study provides evidence on factors affecting Vietnamese people’s fraud susceptibility to cryptocurrency Ponzi schemes, which helps both authorities and individuals to be vigilant against investment scams. Social implications: This research proposes several recommendations to prevent investment scams in cryptocurrency trading, from the perspective of state regulators and individuals. Originality/value: This working paper provides a new approach using PLS-SEM to build a theoretical framework for the possibility of becoming victims of investment scams in Vietnam using a combination of different theories from criminology and finance. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Pairs trading that is built on Relative-Value Arbitrage Rule is a popular short-Term speculation strategy enabling traders to make profits from temporary mispricing of close substitutes. This paper aims at investigating the profit potentials of pairs trading in a new finance area on cryptocurrencies market. The empirical design builds upon four well-known approaches to implement pairs trading, namely: correlation analysis, distance approach, stochastic return differential approach, and cointegration analysis, that use monthly closing prices of leading cryptocoins over the period January 1, 2018, December 31, 2019. Additionally, the paper executes a simulation exercise that compares long-short strategy with long-only portfolio strategy in terms of payoffs and risks. The study finds an inverse relationship between the correlation coefficient and distance between different pairs of cryptocurrencies, which is a prerequisite to determine the potentially market-neutral profits through pairs trading. In addition, pairs trading simulations produce quite substantive evidence on the continuing profitability of pairs trading. In other words, long-short portfolio strategies, producing positive cumulative returns in most subsample periods, consistently outperform conservative long-only portfolio strategies in the cryptocurrency market. The profitability of pairs trading thus adds empirical challenge to the market efficiency of the cryptocurrency market. However, other aspects like spectral correlations and implied volatility might also be significant in determining the profit potentials of pairs trading. © 2021 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

We observe that cryptocurrencies with high market capitalization, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP, have weaker spillovers compared to other cryptocurrencies.

	abstract = {Over the past decade, the development of the fintech sector has been becoming one of the characteristics of Islamic finance. What are the key markets? Who are the investors? What areas of business are Islamic fintech companies represented by? This paper considers above questions by investigating more than 240 Islamic fintech companies, the data on which gathered from IFN Fintech Landscape and Crunchbase. The results of our study show that, firstly, the geography of origin and coverage of Islamic fintech companies is not limited to the countries of the Middle East (79 companies) and Southeast Asia (71), but also includes the developed markets of Western Europe (58 companies) and America (20). Moreover, the most attractive jurisdiction for the incorporation of such companies is the UK (18\% of all Islamic fintech companies were created here). In the Middle East, such a center of gravity is the UAE (13\%). Two markets in Southeast Asia – ​Indonesia and Malaysia – ​form almost a quarter (24\%) of the global Islamic fintech. In addition, Islamic fintech is expanding financial inclusion in Africa, where 11 Islamic fin-tech companies have been established; secondly, 91\% of all Islamic fintech projects were created in the last 10 years, and 58\% in the last 5 years. The peak of activity in this sector fell on the period of 2017 and 2018, when 37 and 39 companies were created, respectively; thirdly, we classify the Islamic fintech into seven broad categories namely, P2P financing (39 companies), neobanks (38), payment services (37), asset management (35), blockchain and cryptocurrency (20), charity (16), real estate (15), among which the most successful cases are considered. In addition, 44 business initiatives were initiated in the field of other near-financial services, including business consulting, analytical support, etc.; fourthly, based on the financial data for 72 Islamic fintech companies in Crunchbase, we estimate the total volume of investments in the Islamic fintech at more than 2.44 bln, almost half of which fell on neobanks (1.2 bln). If we exclude three mega-investments of more than 300 mln, then the average investment into one Islamic fintech company is 19.9 mln, and if we exclude eight investments worth more than 100 mln – ​9.1 mln. Investors of Islamic fintech companies are mainly venture capital funds that finance businesses on the risk-sharing principle. The geography of such funds is not limited to the countries of the Middle East and Southeast Asia, but also includes Western countries (USA, UK, Germany, and Switzerland). We note that at the initial stage, many Islamic fintech projects undergo business mentoring and acceleration programs in special accelerators, including the leading Y Combinator (USA); fifth, we identify five Islamic fintech companies from the CIS, besides, we find Russian-speaking founders of five Islamic fintech companies established in the UAE, Singapore and UK. In addition, we identify Russian venture fund that has invested in two Islamic fintech companies in Bahrain and UAE. Thus, the features of Islamic fintech that we have identified show that the complex and intertwined world of finance is not constrained by borders and prejudices, but the only investment efficiency criteria is the optimal risk-to-reward ratio. © 2022, Russian Academy of Sciences.

Due to the uncertainty as to the possible future trajectories of the evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem, governments have taken a relatively hands-off approach to regulating such currencies. This approach may be justified within the theoretical information-economics framework of this paper, which draws parallels between the information economics of money and quasi-money creation within the current central banking, commercial banking, and shadow banking systems with that of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In particular, drawing lessons from the literature on the role of information in creating 'safe assets', in this paper the authors find that by building on symmetric (common) knowledge as to the inner workings of the Bitcoin Blockchain-though in a different way-BTC possesses a degree of endogenous information insensitivity typical of safe assets. This endogenous information insensitivity could support BTC's promise of maturing into a viable store of value and a niche medium of exchange.

	abstract = {New forms of money invite informed speculation regarding future possibilities. In this extended commentary, we explore five issue-areas that the growth of cryptocurrency and, more particularly, stablecoin have evoked. This new form of digital money has the potential to change the form and functioning of payments technologies and thus alter not just how something is paid for but what can be paid for. Moreover, as the now shelved plans for Facebook/Meta's Libra/Diem indicate, there is scope for a major corporation or coalition of corporations to issue their own stablecoin and this greatly increases the likelihood of a 'systemic' stablecoin. This, in turn, could change where power resides and who exercises it in banking, finance and society. Concern with power leads to issues regarding the nature of change and thus to concern with possible financial, economic and social disruptions ranging across the nature of trust, bank business models, the effectiveness of central bank policy and security of payments systems. Given these issues, cryptocurrency and stablecoin have become a growing concern for regulators and this concern extends to the case for a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC). Finally, a new form of money invites discussion of its implications for the nature of money and this leads to matters of philosophical or social theory interest. \&copy; 2023 The Author(s).

Entrepreneurs' ability to signal quality is crucial to succeeding in the competition for growth capital. However, the absence of institutions that verify endogenous signals may induce a moral hazard in signaling. Consistent with this hypothesis, artificial linguistic intelligence indicates that token issuers systematically exaggerate information disclosed in whitepapers. Exaggerating entrepreneurs raise more funds in less time, suggesting that investors do not see through this practice initially. Eventually, the crowd learns about the exaggeration bias through trading with other investors. The resulting investor disappointment causes the cryptocurrency to depreciate and the probability of platform failure to increase. © 2020 The Author},

For this purpose, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is performed, attempting to describe the areas of fintech activities, propose a categorization for this literature, highlight the main issues dealt with to date in the sample publications, as well as to point out new questions for continuing research in this field. The results show a set of definitions for the term fintech and suggest as a comprehensive understanding of fintech, as innovative companies active in the financial industry making use of the availability of communication, the ubiquity of the internet, and the automated processing of information. Moreover, the literature focuses on financial services and innovations, dealing with issues of financial industry regulation and local legislation or the financial system globally. The innovation of research subcategories (technology adoption/network externalities), blockchain and security appear with great emphasis in this work and represent the current most sensitive aspects also linked to the more global theme of digital transformation.

In the context of analyzing and understanding Mikadof’s costumers (fintech start-up that offers services to facilitate decision-making in the stock and cryptocurrency markets), a systematic literature review was conducted to get a clearer picture of existing research that has been around the segmentation of fintech customers. The results showed a gap in the research that deals with the segmentation of these types of consumers. Nevertheless, several researches were about the stimuli that drive consumers to adopt a fintech solution. Understanding and analyzing these stimuli is an important step in segmenting these fintech consumers. According to the review, the Technology Adoption Model (TAM) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) were among the most mentioned theories explaining the reasons for adopting new technologies. Security, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness were among the variables most used by the authors to explain the intention to use new technologies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Cryptocurrendes' popularity has surged during the last few years. This is especially the case of bitcoin; one among cryptocurrendes which price has soared from USD1,000 in the first quarter of 2017 to USD20,000 by the end of 2017. It has now being used by merchants as a medium of exchange. Upon realizing its popularity, the CME Group that owns the Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched a futures contract on bitcoin. Yet, there are clses where bitcoin is banned by the country. This artide examines the implication of bitcoin on Islamic finance and questions its acceptance as a medium of exchange (money) based on its compliancy with shari'ah. By analyzing its nature and characteristics, the paper concludes that, stridly speaking, cryptocurrendes that are not backed with real assets are not shari'ah-compliant. However, the majority of shari'ah scholars are leaning towards approving bitcoin on maslahah basis Bitcoin is neither fiat money nor real money. The absence of an intrinsic value coupled with lack or zero supervision by the central bank will result in misusing bitcoin. Furthermore, we content that it has the elements of maysir and gharar. This can contribute towards sodo-economic injustices, thereby jeopardizing the maqasid al-shari'ah. Hence, based on a thorough analysis, we conclude that fiat cryptocurrendes are not shari'ah compliant. However, gold-backed cryptocurrendes are argued to be desirable and consistent with the maqasid al shari'ah. © 2018 Authors. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The cryptocurrency market is volatile, non-stationary and non-continuous. Together with liquid derivatives markets, this poses a unique opportunity to study risk management, especially the hedging of options, in a turbulent market. We study the hedge behaviour and effectiveness for the class of affine jump diffusion models and infinite activity Lévy processes. First, market data is calibrated to stochastic volatility inspired-implied volatility surfaces to price options. To cover a wide range of market dynamics, we generate Monte Carlo price paths using an stochastic volatility with correlated jumps model, a close-to-actual-market GARCH-filtered kernel density estimation as well as a historical backtest. In all three settings, options are dynamically hedged with Delta, Delta–Gamma, Delta–Vega and Minimum Variance strategies. Including a wide range of market models allows to understand the trade-off in the hedge performance between complete, but overly parsimonious models, and more complex, but incomplete models. The calibration results reveal a strong indication for stochastic volatility, low jump frequency and evidence of infinite activity. Short-dated options are less sensitive to volatility or Gamma hedges. For longer-dated options, tail risk is consistently reduced by multiple-instrument hedges, in particular by employing complete market models with stochastic volatility. © 2023, The Author(s).},

This paper identifies the sixteen most important attributes that this cryptocurrency would need to be a credible and viable monetary reform alternative. We call the breadth and depth of these attributes a cryptocurrency's scope and refer to the act of adopting an optimal cryptocurrency, cryptozation. HACC (Hyperinflation Alternative Cryptocurrency) is our name for this specially designed (i.e., “optimal”) cryptocurrency. To succeed, the HACC would need to have near-immediate curative properties and provide user nations with a foundation for long-term growth and financial development. The HACC should be built for use by any nation considering currency reform, even those thousands of miles apart. As more nations adopt it, the HACC's network would grow, increasing users’ trust and use. The HACC would sharply curtail a central bank's ability to finance government deficits and bail out failing, nonviable financial institutions, thereby incentivizing them to manage their financial risks more prudently. It would also eliminate or sharply curtail ways in which governments and central banks can earn seigniorage returns. © 2020 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois},

	abstract = {One of the noteworthy developments in the world economy is the crypto-currency in general and the bitcoin in particular. Although several types of cryptocurrency are in operation in the current digital economy, the most prevalent is the bitcoin, which was launched formally in 2009 by an individual or group known under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The value of bitcoin has increased to such an extend that it reached 19.7 billion US dollars by January 2, 2018 (Statista, 2018). As the bitcoin price touches a new high day by day, various terrorist organizations are using this crypto-currency to anonymously finance their grotesque terrorist activities around the world by bypassing the surveillance mechanism of the banking system of the respective countries. Against this backdrop, this chapter aims to understand the mechanism of cryptocurrencies in general and the bitcoin in particular. Finally, it also endeavors to identify the trend of the bitcoin economy and its impact on nefarious activities in general and terrorism financing in particular. It has been revealed from the study that cryptocur-rency economy has become so popular across the world that it has created an alternative virtual economy devoid of regulations from a specific country or a group of countries. By using vector error correction model (VECM), it had been observed that there exists a statistically significant long-run association between terrorist incidences and bitcoin transaction/ circulation in the panel of 12 countries for 2010-2016. However, there is a huge concern over its way of operation and its unholy nexus with terrorism financing. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The Fourth industrial revolution has seen many innovative technologies that are now challenging traditional economies. The innovative and technological financial instruments are inspiring individuals and expert investors to investigate the broader investment spectrum, and consequently diversify their portfolios. Going beyond the conventional portfolios and developing state-of-the-art strategies that comply with the ever-changing financial and technological advancements are the keys to long term sustainability. Therefore, to cater to the needs of all segments of the society, the investment strategies during the fourth industrial revolution demand exposure to technological and digital financial innovations. This study investigates the impact of diversification with the addition of five cryptocurrencies from November 2015 to November 2019 on four traditional asset portfolios. The results show that the diversification increased the returns in most of the cases, and reduced the portfolio volatility in all portfolios, and also provided higher returns as compared to the traditional portfolios for the same level of risk. This study also revealed that the results might improve when short sales are allowed. Moreover, we can conclude that the addition of multiple cryptocurrencies in a portfolio provides enhanced results for diversification, and Ethereum provides a better diversification opportunity as compared to Bitcoin. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

While our results do not have a causal interpretation, they provide preliminary evidence that both mechanisms are effective for expanding and strengthening networks, particularly for decentralized exchanges.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study hopes to encourage further research into the topic of local currencies, as well as specific research into increasing the efficiency of these systems through the use of blockchain technology. There is currently a lack of available research into the topic, which poses barriers for those who wish to study it, so the paper provides a general overview to be used as a starting point for those wishing to broaden their knowledge of local currency systems while also introducing a working implementation of a proof-of-concept for the proposed system. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review of available studies on local currencies is conducted to provide an overview of the current systems and their shortcomings. Subsequently, blockchain technology is briefly introduced and an Ethereum-based model is proposed, which helps overcome the problems identified. The section exploring the Ethereum-based model draws code written by the author to simulate the features. Findings: The paper concludes that blockchain technology can significantly help improve efficiency, transparency and security of local currency systems, while also helping cut costs associated with the implementation of a complementary monetary system. In the medium-term, local currency systems will most likely use a blockchain protocol as the underlying technology for the network. Originality/value: Local currencies are an understudied topic by itself and the intersection between them and blockchain is a nearly non-existent research space. Thus, the paper takes a multidisciplinary approach, aiming to bridge the fields of computer science and economics to provide a foundation for further research. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: The closing prices of six cryptocurrencies have been considered. The study employs different classical tests for checking if the efficiency behaviour is similar during Ramadan celebration days and non-Ramadan days. Besides, dummy variable regression technique for assessing this anomaly on returns and volatilities has been applied. Findings: Although no significant effect on returns and volatility for Litecoin has been found, the results provide evidence about the existence of the Ramadan effects in cryptocurrency markets. The results of the mean equations show the existence of Ramadan effect for Ethereum, Ripple, Stellar and BinanceCoin for all considered models. Significant effect on Bitcoin returns is found with an autoregressive model of order 1. The results of conditional volatility show Ramadan effect on volatility is not detected. Originality/value: First, a new contribution in the incipient study of cryptocurrency analysis. Second, a comprehensive review of recently published empirical articles about Ramadan effect on traditional assets has been carried out. Third, unlike most of the papers focussed on the study of Bitcoin, this study has been extended to six cryptocurrencies. Ramadan effect have not been analysed in cryptomarkets yet.

However, there is a steep development curve for quantitative traders to obtain an agent that automatically positions to win in the market, namely to decide where to trade, at what price and what quantity, due to the error-prone programming and arduous debugging. In this paper, we present the first open-source framework FinRL as a full pipeline to help quantitative traders overcome the steep learning curve. FinRL is featured with simplicity, applicability and extensibility under the key principles, full-stack framework, customization, reproducibility and hands-on tutoring. Embodied as a three-layer architecture with modular structures, FinRL implements fine-tuned state-of-the-art DRL algorithms and common reward functions, while alleviating the debugging workloads. Thus, we help users pipeline the strategy design at a high turnover rate. At multiple levels of time granularity, FinRL simulates various markets as training environments using historical data and live trading APIs. Being highly extensible, FinRL reserves a set of user-import interfaces and incorporates trading constraints such as market friction, market liquidity and investor's risk-aversion.

Despite receiving extensive public attention, theoretical understanding is limited regarding the value of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, as expressed in their exchange rates against traditional currencies. In this paper, we conduct a theory-driven empirical study of the Bitcoin exchange rate (against USD) determination, taking into consideration both technology and economic factors. To address co-integration in a mix of stationary and non-stationary time series, we use the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model with a bounds test approach in the estimation. Meanwhile, to detect potential structural changes, we estimate our empirical model on two periods separated by the closure of Mt. Gox (one of the largest Bitcoin exchange markets). According to our analysis, in the short term, the Bitcoin exchange rate adjusts to changes in economic fundamentals and market conditions. The long-term Bitcoin exchange rate is more sensitive to economic fundamentals and less sensitive to technological factors after Mt. Gox closed. We also identify a significant impact of mining technology and a decreasing significance of mining difficulty in the Bitcoin exchange price determination. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In recent years, with a rise in climate change, the notion of sustainable development and resource productivity has received a lot of attention around the world. Meanwhile, advances in artificial intelligence based financial management and the creation of new blockchains or cryptocurrencies have transformed the day-to-day operations of economic actors. The aim of the present study is to investigate the impact of financial management and blockchains on environmental sustainability and resource productivity. The monthly time series data of the United States of America economy data is used covering the period from 2000M01–2022M09. Firstly, the stationary variable is tested using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron tests. The findings reveal that all the variables follow I(1). The long-term estimations are investigated through the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares. The findings reveal that artificial intelligence-based financial management helps to improve environmental sustainability and resource productivity by reducing carbon emissions and increasing combustible and renewable waste, metals, and non-metallic minerals resources in the long run. In addition, blockchain technology appears to be a booster for environmental unsustainability while also reducing metallic resources. These findings are particularly important and critical since they indicate the path to achieving Sustainable Development Goals. Overall, the findings imply that the United States of America authorities should continue to push AI-based sustainability models and move to green blockchains in order to mitigate the negative environmental effects of blockchains. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	doi = {10.1016/j.iref.2021.05.003},
	abstract = {There is considerable interest in the impact of investor attention on investment returns, especially for cryptocurrencies. However, previous research does not distinguish between search-engine attention and social-media forms of attention—even though this distinction is emphasized by marketing professionals. Professional marketers emphasize that attention is optimized by combinations of social-media and search-engine presence. We investigate the bi-directional causalities, and concomitant frequencies, between cryptocurrency returns and investor attention, comparing cryptocurrency sensitivity to Twitter tweets and the intensity of Google searches, as well as combinations of Twitter and Google. For 27 cryptocurrencies, we use a non-parametric wavelet Granger causality test to incorporate multiple time horizons. We also employ Diebold and Yilmaz spillover testing to assess respective pairwise influence between attention measures and respective cryptocurrencies. Results indicate a preponderance of bidirectional Granger causality for the great majority of cryptocurrencies, with the impact of Twitter on cryptocurrencies being shorter term. Consistent with expectations, we identify that bi-directional causalities, and spillovers, of cryptocurrencies with investor attention are significantly more evident for proxies of investor attention that are combinations of social media (Twitter) and search engine intensity (Google), rather than either one of these forms alone. Our results have applicability to a broad range of investor attention studies. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

This proposed design allows central banks to manage the process flow, focus on the monitoring and control, without bearing all the load or exposing to over-centralized risks. It concludes that CBDC will be the primary tool in the future digital economy, and countries that are conversant with the technology will have a competitive advantage.

	volume = {13},
	doi = {10.18288/1994-5124-2018-6-122-135},
	abstract = {Появление криптовалют стало серьезным вызовом для гражданского права и публично- правового регулирования. Криптовалюта - это новый объект гражданского права, и его правовой режим только складывается. В России по состоянию на начало декабря 2018 года законодательное регулирование деятельности, связанной с криптовалютами, отсутствует. Тем не менее криптовалюты уже начали фигурировать в судебных делах. Показательным примером стал процесс о банкротстве Ильи Царькова, проходивший в 2017-2018 годах. Должник сообщил управляющему банкрота о наличии у него некоторой суммы в биткойнах. На очередном заседании Арбитражного суда г. Москвы финансовый управляющий подал ходатайство о включении в конкурсную массу криптовалюты, так как она является имуще- ством. Суд отказался это сделать, аргументировав свое решение тем, что правоотношения по поводу криптовалюты не урегулированы в российском законодательстве - в нем даже нет такого понятия. Однако Девятый апелляционный арбитражный суд согласился с доводами финансового управляющего и постановил включить биткойны в конкурсную массу. Согласно аргументации суда второй инстанции при надлежащем применении принципов гражданского права криптовалюта не может трактоваться иначе чем «иное имущество». Отказ от включе- ния ее в конкурсную массу нарушает права кредиторов. Определение суда первой инстанции служит ярким примером буквализма в толковании законов, доминирующего в российском правосудии. В то же время решение суда апелляционной инстанции показывает, что в опреде- ленных ситуациях, связанных с хозяйственными спорами и защитой прав кредиторов, этот буквализм может быть преодолен в рамках судебной ветви власти. Более того, это может быть достигнуто даже при отсутствии в писаном праве норм, непосредственно применимых к рассматриваемому случаю. Примененная апелляционным судом трактовка криптовалюты как иного имущества (в терминах Гражданского кодекса) согласуется с концепцией проекта закона «О цифровых финансовых активах», внесенного в Государственную Думу Министер- ством финансов РФ.; Cryptocurrency is a brand new civil law object and its legal framework is in a formative stage. As of early December 2018, no federal law regulating activities with cryptocurrencies is enacted in Russia. Nevertheless, cryptocurrency issues have already appeared in court cases, in particular in connection with defense of creditors' rights. An emblematic case in this respect is the recent personal bankruptcy trial of Ilia Tsarkov, which was held at the Moscow Arbitrazh Court. The bankruptcy trustee requested to include the bitcoins in possession of the debtor in the bankruptcy estate. The debtor objected to this, his key argument being that legal relations concerning cryptocurrencies (or bitcoins) were not regulated by Russian legislation and even the concept itself was not mentioned in any statute; thus bitcoins could not be legally treated as property. However, the second-instance court agreed with the trustee's arguments and annulled the first-instance court ruling. The main argument was that, if principles of the Russian civil law were applied properly, then bitcoins should be treated as "other property". In addition, the use of the first-instance court's arguments opens the door for infringe ment of property rights of creditors. The first-instance court's ruling is an obvious illustration of dominant textualism in Russian judiciary. The appellate court's decision, on the other hand, demonstrates that said textualism could be overcome by judiciary actions at least in some circumstances such as defense of creditors' rights. The treatment of cryptocurrency as "other property" by the court is in general agreement with the conception of the Ministry of Finance's draft law "On digital financial assets". © 2018 Editorial Board of the Journal Economic Policy.},

This may induce increased investor participation with the chance of excessive liquidity in the cryptocurrency market, which can impair financial stability should there be shocks to the cryptocurrency market. This provides grounds to uncover the degree of integration between cryptocurrencies and African stock markets, which has been completely untouched using wavelet-based methods and frequency domain spillover index. Such knowledge is critical since shocks to the cryptocurrency market may have rippling effects on African stock markets. Findings suggest low degrees of integration between the markets at higher frequencies, which grows stronger at medium frequencies and perfectly integrates at lower frequencies. The implication is that stock markets in Africa are highly exposed to cryptocurrency market disruptions from the medium-term, and international investors seeking to hedge their price risk in African stock markets using cryptocurrencies may have to look at the short term. We find cryptocurrencies as significant spillover transmitters across frequencies.

The subject of research is not only this technology but also its commercial exploitation. In order to understand the platform, the starting point of this research is an analysis of how the technology functions, after that the advantages for business and economic transaction are identified, and finally the paper deals with an impact of new technology on business, above all on financial operations. The basic hypothesis is that blockchain has achieved a great impact on financial sector, also it has the potential to radically change only the financial sector but also the way we buy and sell, our interaction with the authorities as a way of verifying the ownership from the authorship and the organic food production. Using the available data and synthesis of knowledge from the fields of technology, economics, finance, and politics, 4 scenarios were set up for the future of underlying technology. The scenario approach combined with trend analysis in order to prove the starting hypothesis with high reliability. The research results show that the technology being investigated already has a profound impact on the financial sector, that it is in the initial phase of changing many industries, with the likelihood that they will change them significantly in the next five to ten years.

Based on daily data covering the period from January 1, 2020 to January 31, 2022, we combine Diebold and Yilmaz's (2012, 2014) time domain spillover approach and Ando et al.'s (2022) quantile regression framework to investigate the time-frequency spillover connectedness among markets and measure the direction and intensity of the net transmission effect under extreme negative and positive event conditions, and normal states. We further provide novel insights into the green finance literature by examining sensitivity to quantile analysis of the net transfer mechanism between green bonds, cryptocurrencies, and pandemic uncertainty. Regarding the network connectedness analysis, the results reveal strong net information spillover transmission among markets under the bearish market. In extremely negative event circumstances, the MSCI Euro green bond acts as the leading net shock receiver in the system, whereas COVID-19 fake news appears as the largest net shock contributor, followed by BTC. According to sensitivity to quantile analysis, the net dynamic shock transfer mechanism is time-varying and quantile-dependent.

The number of Bitcoins is limited (by design) to 21 million. In this respect Bitcoin is similar to gold. In addition, it is extremely easy to transfer Bitcoins between any locations in the world, at high speed and at very low cost. This paper looks at Bitcoin from the central bank's perspective. Taking into consideration central bank's goals and functions, possible consequences of Bitcoin usage are discussed. It is shown, that any purchase of Bitcoins in no way could increase inflation. To the contrary, it may tend to support deflation. What concerns financial stability: Bitcoin does not yet have the scale to act as a systemic contagion of instability or lapse in network integrity. But the real problem could be substantial involvement of financial institutions in cryptocurrencies. From a central bank's perspective this might be quite dangerous and should be limited by law. If Bitcoin begins to undermine the financial and tax systems they will be shut down and all contracts between traders would be unenforceable.

	doi = {10.1108/SEF-10-2021-0436},
	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to analyze the time-varying correlation between the cryptocurrency policy uncertainty (UCRY Policy) and cryptocurrency returns. More specifically, it analyzes whether these correlations vary according to the uncertainty attributable to salient events such as China banning ICOs, cryptocurrency exchanges attacks, Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic crisis and the United States (U.S.) Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) announcement about Ripple. Design/methodology/approach: To measure the dynamic relationship, it uses the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) model of Engle (2002) to consider time variation in UCRY Policy and cryptocurrency returns. The data set encompasses the weekly frequency data of the UCRY Policy and Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP), Stellar (XLM), Dash (DASH), Monero (XMR) from 4 September 2016, to 21 February 2021. Findings: Empirical findings indicate that the correlations between the UCRY Policy and the BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, XLM, DASH and XMR returns are consistently negative. Thus, an increase in the volatility of the UCRY Policy can lead to a decrease in volatility for BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, XLM, DASH and XMR returns. Besides, these findings indicate that the estimated DCC is not only time-varying but also substantially responsive to salient events, such as China banning ICOs, cryptocurrency exchanges attacks, the Covid-19 pandemic crisis and SEC’s announcement about Ripple. Besides, empirical findings show that cryptocurrency returns are adversely impacted by UCRY Policy during the salient events (China bans ICOs, the hack of cryptocurrency exchanges, Covid-19 crisis), suggesting their failure to act as a hedge or safe-haven asset. Originality/value: To the best of the author’s knowledge, this study investigates the time-varying correlation between UCRY Policy and cryptocurrency returns. Besides, this study may be useful for new studies and fill a gap in the finance literature, due to the limited number of studies on the UCRY Policy in the finance literature. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Blockchain and artificial intelligence are perhaps the two most significant disruptive technologies this century and both will significantly rewire the world of global financial markets and the world in which we live. While blockchain offers a number of significant advantages over traditional forms of finance including lower cost and massive increases in operational efficiencies of traded markets, property records and a whole host of transaction processes, artificial intelligence is moving fast from basic structured machine learning doing menial yet important big data tasks like credit card fraud detection to predictive analysis and real-time real-world risk management and investment decision making. There is still a lot of confusion in the market about cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technology. Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence highlights the underlying technologies of blockchain and the differences between cryptocurrencies and blockchain financial applications. It explores the current AI offerings and gives a vision of the fast-moving developments in this area including the many solutions that are expected to revolutionize the way financial and commodity markets will operate in the future. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {The article deals with a new financial tool of attracting capital, known as Initial Coin Offering (ICO). In conditions of reduced banking lending and difficult access to finance for SMEs, ICO is viewed to be one of the possible ways to access capital. It considers the main advantages and disadvantages of ICO performance, including its typical features, challenges and regulatory approaches to tax regulation, cybersecurity. The authors of the article determine stages of the ICO mechanism, identifying potential risks and ways to mitigate them, focusing primarily on the need to control and regulate ICO projects. The authors identify the main types of ICO funding, including hybrid and pure funding. The research contains an analysis of ICO trends and their duration for the period of 2013-2017. The capital raised through ICO performance over the period of 2013-2017 is analysed, and determination of the exponential trend line showing the level of its approximation is determined. The study covers the territorial distribution of ICO, in which the top positions regarding the amount of capital raised by ICO are attributed to the USA and EU member states. The existence of ICO regulation in European countries, such as Switzerland and UK, was defined positive in terms of further development of the relevant regulation in the financial market. The article considers the best ICO practices in EU member states. To mitigate risks relating to ICO performance and to increase the level of investment, it would be reasonable to create regulatory rules in every country where cases of ICO performance are reported, based on the practice of the mentioned European countries. The authors give recommendations regarding ICO regulation in Ukraine, taking into consideration the relevant European experience. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2018.},

	doi = {10.1080/01966324.2021.1950086},
	abstract = {The study investigates and develops the ability of the extreme value theory (EVT) to predict bitcoin return. EVT is used to deal with rare but extreme events, such as severe losses or excessive damages. It is being used as a powerful statistical tool in various disciplines, including finance, engineering, environmental science, and actuarial science. As the largest among all cryptocurrencies in existence, bitcoin’s behavior is primarily characterized by great volatility. Predicting bitcoin return is complex and important, primarily because of the extreme nature of its return. There is not enough substantial research involving EVT in bitcoin analysis. This study has three objectives. First, confirming the extreme nature of bitcoin return by various statistical tests; second, modeling the bitcoin return using two different EVT approaches (block maxima approach and peak over threshold approach); and third, assessing uncertainties by predicting bitcoin return levels for 5-, 10-, 20-, 50-, and 100-years with a 95\% confidence interval using both of these methods. These results could certainly serve policymakers and investors, as these return levels can be useful in characterizing bearish and bullish trends and predicting the same. Moreover, these can serve as starting points for future studies regarding the stationary and non-stationary properties of bitcoin return. © 2021 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

	title = {A risk redistribution standard for practical cryptocurrency payment},
	doi = {10.1109/DAPPCON.2019.00020},
	abstract = {Cryptocurrencies are developed as a decentralized and trustless payment system, in which participants should be able to conduct payments across borders with acceptable latency. However, the fluctuation of the exchange rate between crypto and fiat currencies has raised significant concerns and thwarted the prevalence of cryptocurrency payment adoption. Existing solutions require merchants to liquidate the received cryptocurrency on an exchange platform. To compensate for the exchange rate risk, merchants tend to charge a higher price in cryptocurrencies compare to in fiat currency, which dampens the incentive of customers to choose cryptocurrencies as the means of payment. This paper proposes an architecture bolstered by smart contracts to transfer the risk from the merchants to the cryptocurrency issuer. This narrows the gap between prices denominated in cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, and thus increases the adoption of cryptocurrencies as a payment method. The Ethereum blockchain is chosen as the experimental environment in this work, yet the architecture can be migrated to other decentralized systems without additional efforts. This work devises a novel ERC¹ standard to resolve the payment at a predetermined exchange rate that can be employed by any existing cryptocurrency. Immutable events on the blockchain will be generated upon the issuance and settlement of a payment, which are considered as the receipts for granting rights to the merchants to settle the payment at a regular basis. The architecture demonstrates a notable reduction on the exchange rate risk for the merchants, solving the primary problem of cryptocurrency payment adoptions nowadays. © 2019 IEEE.},

	doi = {10.1108/CFRI-03-2020-0026},
	abstract = {Purpose: The authors make a fundamental initial effort to conduct a systematic review analysis on “cryptocurrency,” mainly to analyze the way it has been changing the “stereotype” financial transactions, and also identify the probable unexplored research avenues on this innovative investment regime. The study aims to draw the landscape of the current state, prospects, challenges, trends and possible agendas of cryptocurrency in the global market. Design/methodology/approach: Using a quali-quantitative approach widely known as meta-literature review, the synthesis analysis on “cryptocurrency” is conducted. Methodologically, the authors review and analyze the most recent and relevant papers preferably published between 2016 and 2020 in leading business and finance journals of ISI Web of Science (ISI WOS) through bibliometric analysis particularly coupled with content analysis. Findings: The findings of the meta-analysis summarize the relevant stylized facts of the cryptocurrency market: distinctive features of blockchain technology, decentralized payment method, low-cost facility, ensuring pseudo-anonymity, independence from central authority, double spending attack protection, organic and instantaneous nature, among others. In addition, the analysis identified several future research regimes: pricing model, prospect of investment regime, hedging properties, volatility dynamics, information asymmetry, underlying risk factors and bubble-like nature in global cryptocurrency market. Practical implications: This academic novelty significantly contributes to enhance our knowledge on the current state-of-the-art of digital finance, outlines the research agenda and eventually provides important investment implications for financial managers, research analysts, investors, market practitioners, regulatory compliance professionals and policymakers. Therefore, the findings shed the lights on new investment opportunity in the global market. Originality/value: Cryptocurrency, virtual currency or digital asset having cryptography for idiosyncratic security features, seems to be a persistent paradigm shift in the digitalized financial system. Despite the continuing growth, the academic research on cryptocurrency is still at nascent stage, particularly because researchers did not deeply draw attention at this financial innovation. In addition, the authors argue that none of the earlier studies yet conducted a meta-analysis on this latest investment regime. Therefore, this review study is the initial attempt to fill up the gap in the finance literature. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	doi = {10.1145/3419614.3423257},
	abstract = {With the recent rise of cryptocurrencies' popularity, the security and management of crypto-tokens have become critical. We have witnessed many attacks on users and providers, which have resulted in significant financial losses. To remedy these issues, several wallet solutions have been proposed. However, these solutions often lack either essential security features, usability, or do not allow users to customize their spending rules. In this paper, we propose SmartOTPs, a smart-contract wallet framework that gives a flexible, usable, and secure way of managing crypto-tokens in a self-sovereign fashion. The proposed framework consists of four components (i.e., an authenticator, a client, a hardware wallet, and a smart contract), and it provides 2-factor authentication (2FA) performed in two stages of interaction with the blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first one that utilizes one-time passwords (OTPs) in the setting of the public blockchain. In SmartOTPs, the OTPs are aggregated by a Merkle tree and hash chains whereby for each authentication only a short OTP (e.g., 16B-long) is transferred from the authenticator to the client. Such a novel setting enables us to make a fully air-gapped authenticator by utilizing small QR codes or a few mnemonic words, while additionally offering resilience against quantum cryptanalysis. We have made a proof-of-concept based on the Ethereum platform. Our cost analysis shows that the average cost of a transfer operation is comparable to existing 2FA solutions using smart contracts with multi-signatures. © 2020 ACM.},

We investigated a proposed method to form a non-collateralized stablecoin called the Morini's Scheme of InvSav wallets. We figured out two equations for the rebasement for the Inv wallet balances and then compared the results. We found the second rebasement method to be fairer to the agents, but we found the issue of negative balances with both methods. We proposed novel solutions to overcome these issues. One of the proposed solutions was to freeze some money in the Sav wallet if there is a negative balance in the Inv wallet. Another proposed solution was to introduce a two-money economy of money and antimoney to turn the current centralized token distribution model decentralized and make transactions more probable even if agents do not have enough money funds; this could be seen as a decentralized version of credit cards. © 2021 IEEE.},

Challenges come along as well, concerning the collection, secure storage, verification and secure access to the continuously growing data at such a broad scale before valuable information can be extracted to contribute to medical advancement nowadays. With the decentralization feature, huge successes of blockchain technology in overcoming similar challenges in the finance and cryptocurrency sector brought us the confidence to investigate and reveal its immeasurable potential for the health sector, specifically in dentistry. Dentistry is an important area of healthcare, but there is relatively little research focusing on its interactions with blockchain technology. Given the limited amount of existing research on this specific subject, this paper focuses on blockchain in dentistry and aims to provide a conceptual framework for the possible applications of blockchain in dentistry. The framework is organised by different areas of dentistry operations so that dental professionals can easily refer to and identify areas of interest. This contributes to increasing the awareness of blockchain technology among dental professionals and promoting blockchain-empowered revolutions in dentistry. This paper also discusses how blockchain fits alongside other emerging technologies, the challenges that have to be overcome to maximise the functionality and efficiency of this technology, as well as future research directions concerning blockchain implementations in the dental industry. © 2023 by the authors.},

	volume = {39},
	doi = {10.1108/SEF-06-2021-0237},
	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to explore netizen’s opinions on cryptocurrency under the lens of emotion theory and lexicon sentiments analysis via machine learning. Design/methodology/approach: An automated Web-scrapping via RStudio is performed to collect the data of 15,000 tweets on cryptocurrency. Sentiment lexicon analysis is done via machine learning to evaluate the emotion score of the sample. The types of emotion tested are anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, trust and the two primary sentiments, i.e. negative and positive. Findings: The supervised machine learning discovers a total score of 53,077 sentiments from the sampled 15,000 tweets. This score is from the artificial intelligence evaluation of eight emotions, i.e. anger (2\%), anticipation (18\%), disgust (1\%), fear (3\%), joy (15\%), sadness (3\%), surprise (7\%), trust (15\%) and the two sentiments, i.e. negative (4\%) and positive (33\%). The result indicates that the sample primarily contains positive sentiments. This finding is theoretically significant to measure the emotion theory on the sampled tweets that can best explain the social implications of the cryptocurrency phenomenon. Research limitations/implications: This work is limited to evaluate the sampled tweets’ sentiment scores to explain the social implication of cryptocurrency. Practical implications: The finding is necessary to explain the recent phenomenon of cryptocurrency. The positive sentiment may describe the increase in investment in the decentralised finance market. Meanwhile, the anticipation emotion may illustrate the public’s reaction to the bubble prices of cryptocurrencies. Social implications: Previous studies find that the social signals, e.g. word-of-mouth, netizens’ opinions, among others, affect the cryptocurrencies’ movement prices. This paper helps explain the social implications of such dynamic of pricing via sentiment analysis. Originality/value: This study contributes to theoretically explain the implications of the cryptocurrency phenomenon under the emotion theory. Specifically, this study shows how supervised machine learning can measure the emotion theory from data tweets to explain the implications of cryptocurrencies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We introduce the concept of the technical frontier to delimit the kinds of interactions that can feasibly be structured algorithmically among pseudonymous agents, as on a blockchain, and show that lending and financial intermediation – unlike monetary exchange – lie outside it, even in simple forms. The path forward for truly blockchain-native financial applications, therefore, must involve the integration of real-world identity information in order to disincentivize defection.

This study explores comovements between three green and socially responsible financial assets, S\&P global clean energy index (GCEI), S\&P green bonds index (GB), DJ sustainability world index (DJSWI) and four cryptocurrency uncertainty/attention indices cryptocurrency policy uncertainty index, Central Bank Digital Currencies Uncertainty Index, Central Bank Digital Currencies Attentions Index and Index of Cryptocurrency Environmental Attention using the bivariate wavelet coherence approach. The findings show that GCEI, GB, DJSWI returns have consistent positive comovement with all cryptocurrency uncertainty/attention indices in the medium-term, suggesting their time-varying leading role. Evidence of negative coherences shows that higher cryptocurrency uncertainties/attentions lead to lower green financial asset returns, reflecting the adverse impact of higher uncertainties/attention on the trust of green and sustainable investors. The above empirical findings offer up-to-date insights for guiding policymakers, and regulators, enabling them in environmental policy development. Furthermore, socially responsible investors can make better investment judgments by considering the environmental concerns in the cryptocurrency marketplaces. © 2022 Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA.},

	abstract = {As the number of cryptocurrencies has exploded in recent years, so too has the fraud. One popular strategy is when actors promote coordinated purchases of coins in hopes of temporarily driving up prices. Prior work investigating such pump and dump schemes has focused on the immediate impact to prices following pump signals, which were largely interpreted as following the same strategy. The reality, as with most cybercrimes, is that the operators of the schemes try out a much more heterogeneous mix of tactics. From a population of 12,252 pump signals observed between July 2017 and January 2019, we identify and examine 3,683 so-called target-based pump signals that announce promoted coins alongside buy and sell targets, but without a coordinated purchase time. We develop a strategy to measure the success of target pumps over longer time horizons. We find that around half of these pumps reach at least one of their sell targets, and that reaching their peak price often takes days, as opposed to the seconds or minutes required in pumps studied previously. We also examine the various groups promoting coins and present evidence that groups try a variety of distinct strategies and experience varying success. We find that the most successful groups promote many coins and issue many pumps, but not for the same coins. As decentralized finance becomes more popular, a deeper understanding of price manipulation techniques like target pumps is needed to combat fraud. © 2021 ACM.},

Cryptocurrency investors are more likely to invest in stocks with high media sentiment and more likely to employ heuristics from technical analysis. In line with attention effects and anticipatory utility, we find that the average cryptocurrency investor substantially increases account logins and trading activity after his or her first cryptocurrency purchase.

	doi = {10.1108/QRAM-03-2021-0051},
	abstract = {Purpose: Decentralized finance (DeFi), enabled by blockchain, could bring about a new financial system, where peers will interact directly, with little or no place for traditional intermediation. However, some crucial tasks cannot be left solely to an algorithm and, consequently, most DeFi applications still require human decisions. The aim of this research is to assess the role of intermediation in the light of DeFi, analysing how humans and algorithms will interact. Design/methodology/approach: The authors based their work on a twofold qualitative methodology, first analysing publicly available secondary data, particularly from white papers and DeFi Pulse (a website providing data on DeFi solutions) and then running two focus group discussions. Findings: DeFi does not eliminate financial intermediation, but enables it to be performed in new ways, where decentralization means that no single entity can hold too much power or monopoly. DeFi has, however, inherited risks from the underlying technologies that unintentionally facilitate illegal behaviour and can hamper the authorities’ supervision. The complex duality algorithm- vs human-based actions will not be solved indisputably in favour of the former, as DeFi solutions can range from requiring algorithms to play a dominant role, to enabling greater human interaction by actively involving more people. Originality/value: This research contributes to the emerging debate between algorithm- and human-based intermediation, especially in relation to the standing literature on financial intermediation, where considerations made in the light of the newest theories on blockchain and DeFi are still scarce. © 2022, Laura Grassi, Davide Lanfranchi, Alessandro Faes and Filippo Maria Renga.},

	abstract = {This paper studies how sentiment affect Bitcoin pricing by examining, at an hourly frequency, the linkage between sentiment of finance-related Twitter messages and return as well as the volatility of Bitcoin as a financial asset. On the one hand, there was calculated the return from minute-level Bitcoin exchange quotes and use of both rolling variance and high-minus-low price to proxy for Bitcoin volatility per each trading hour. On the other hand, the mood signals from tweets were extracted based on a list of positive, negative, and uncertain words according to the Loughran-McDonald finance-specific dictionary. These signals were translated by categorizing each tweet into one of three sentiments, namely, bullish, bearish, and null. Then the total number of tweets were adopted in each category over one hour and their differences as potential Bitcoin price predictors. The empirical results indicate that after controlling a list of lagged returns and volatilities, stronger bullish sentiment significantly foreshadows higher Bitcoin return and volatility overthe time range of 24 hours. While bearish and neutral financial Twitter sentiments have no such consistent performance, the difference between bullish and bearish ratings can improve prediction consistency. Overall, this research results add to the growing Bitcoin literature by demonstrating that the Bitcoin pricing mechanism can be partially revealed by the momentum on sentiment in social media networks, justifying a sentimental appetite for cryptocurrency investment. © Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {Blockchain enabled systems are becoming increasingly popular in recent times, spreading across variety of domains such as finance, supply chain management, healthcare, etc. These systems usually involve homogeneous transactions with similar latency requirements. However, as increasingly complex systems are enabled through blockchain, they will include a variety of heterogeneous transactions having different latency requirements. For example, an IoT system such as smart building may include transactions corresponding to varied services like payment, biometric registration, etc. Present blockchain systems are transaction metadata agnostic in their ordering step i.e. during ordering and bundling of transactions into blocks. Since transactions in complex systems are heterogeneous in nature, a framework that prioritizes transactions having low latency requirements would be more suitable. In this work, we propose various transaction criticality aware ordering services and comprehensively evaluate them on a handcrafted smart building scenario. Our experiments demonstrate that a single ordering service is not suitable (in terms of number of transactions missing their latency requirement) for all practical scenarios. We demonstrate that selection of a suitable ordering service may give up to 58.25\% improvement over other ordering services. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Interoperation for data sharing between permissioned blockchain networks relies on networks' abilities to independently authenticate requests and validate proofs accompanying the data; these typically contain digital signatures. This requires counterparty networks to know the identities and certification chains of each other's members, establishing a common trust basis rooted in identity. But permissioned networks are ad hoc consortia of existing organizations, whose network affiliations may not be well-known or well-established even though their individual identities are. In this paper, we describe an architecture and set of protocols for distributed identity management across permissioned blockchain networks to establish a trust basis for data sharing. Networks wishing to interoperate can associate with one or more distributed identity registries that maintain credentials on shared ledgers managed by groups of reputed identity providers. A network's participants possess self-sovereign decentralized identities (DIDs) on these registries and can obtain privacy-preserving verifiable membership credentials. During interoperation, networks can securely and dynamically discover each others' latest membership lists and members' credentials. We implement a solution based on Hyperledger Indy and Aries, and demonstrate its viability and usefulness by linking a trade finance network with a trade logistics network, both built on Hyperledger Fabric. We also analyze the extensibility, security, and trustworthiness of our system. © 2021 IEEE.},

We examine how ICOs can be leveraged in the context of asset tokenization, whereby firms issue tokens backed by future assets (i.e., inventory) to finance growth. We (i) make suggestions on how to design such “asset-backed” ICOs—including optimal token floating and pricing for both utility and equity tokens (a.k.a. security token offerings)—taking into account moral hazard (cash diversion), product characteristics, and customer demand uncertainty; (ii) make predictions on ICO success/failure; and (iii) discuss implications on firm operating strategy. We show that in unregulated environments, ICOs can lead to significant agency costs, underproduction, and loss of firm value. These inefficiencies, however, fade as product margins and demand characteristics (mean/variance) improve, and they are less severe under equity (rather than utility) token issuance. Importantly, the advantage of equity tokens stems from their inherent ability to better align incentives and thus continues to hold even absent regulation. © 2020 INFORMS.},

Using the Baur and McDermott model, we examine hedge, safe haven, and diversifier properties of all assets for all G7 country’s major indexes as well as all BRICS major indexes breaking it down by two attributes: kind of blockchain technology and pre/during COVID health crisis. Results show that both attributes play an important role in the hedge, safe haven, and diversifier properties associated with the asset.

This paper provides a comprehensive review on the financial applications of Bitcoin. The focus is on three lines of research: price formation, detection of market inefficiency, and diversified portfolio construction. Topics such as market micro-structure and the interplay between different cryptocurrencies are only touched on briefly. We observe that many empirical studies find that Bitcoin markets are inefficient, with huge price fluctuations and long-range memory, and that these markets are heavily influenced by news and sector-specific events, or by infrastructure conditions such as volume trading and market liquidity. Nevertheless, astonishing price appreciations and modest correlation values versus other asset classes have contributed significantly to motivate applications of Bitcoin to investment and diversification. Future research may address practical implementations of such solutions and investigate the long-term sustainability and viability of these investment strategies. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jbusvent.2018.09.007},
	abstract = {In an initial coin offering (ICO), new ventures raise capital by selling tokens to a crowd of investors. Often, this token is a cryptocurrency, a digital medium of value exchange based on the distributed ledger technology. Both the number of ICOs and the amount of capital raised have exploded since 2017. Despite attracting significant attention from ventures, investors, and policy makers, little is known about the dynamics of ICOs. This initial study therefore assesses the determinants of the amount raised in 423 ICOs. Drawing on signaling theory, the study explores the role of signaling ventures' technological capabilities in ICOs. The results show that technical white papers and high-quality source codes increase the amount raised, while patents are not associated with increased amounts of funding. Exploring further determinants of the amount raised, the results indicate that some of the underlying mechanisms in ICOs resemble those found in prior research into entrepreneurial finance, while others are unique to the ICO context. The study's implications are multifold and discussed in detail. Importantly, the results enable investors to more accurately understand crucial determinants of the amount raised (e.g., technical white papers, source code quality, token supply, Ethereum-standard). This reduces the considerable uncertainty that investors face when investing in ICOs and enables more informed decision-making. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

	title = {Underpricing in the cryptocurrency world: evidence from initial coin offerings},
	volume = {45},
	doi = {10.1108/MF-06-2018-0281},
	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze underpricing in initial coin offerings (ICO). It bridges the gap between findings in initial public offering (IPO) literature and empirical results from ICOs. Design/methodology/approach: The sample set consists of 279 ICOs between April 2013 and January 2018. A regression analysis is performed with data from the ICOs. Findings: The results show an average level of underpricing of ICOs of 123 percent in the USA and 97 percent in the other countries. The results for the US ICOs are significantly higher than for US IPOs on average and also higher than US IPOs at the beginning of the dot.com bubble. The authors also study the determinants of ICO underpricing. The authors use proxies based on asymmetric information from the IPO literature as well as ICO-related variables. First-day trading volume and a good sentiment on the ICO market go together with more ICO underpricing. Moreover, hot markets make first-day investors to benefit less. Finally, companies that use a large issue size or a pre-ICO (a sale of cryptocurrencies before the ICO) leave less money on the table. Research limitations/implications: A first restriction is that the authors focus on ICOs and not on crowdfunding, though there are similarities in that both of them are novel ways to finance projects. A second restriction is that the authors had to decide on the definition of a listing day. Cryptocurrencies are traded on many exchanges, and if the exchange is tailored to the cryptocurrency itself, the data on, e.g., close prices are not necessarily to be trusted. The authors, therefore, decided to use close price data from coinmarketcap.com, which requires a listing on two exchanges. This choice implies that there may have been trades before the listing day itself. A third restriction arises from the relative newness of the ICO phenomenon. The authors gathered data on underpricing from coinmarketcap.com and combined that with project information from icobench.com. However, the data were not simply matched and they required manual adjustments based on several other sources. The authors hope that in due time data on ICOs will be as adequate as data on IPOs and that they become more readily available. It might help if regulators or the crypto community would institute publication requirements. Adherence to such requirements would also reduce the extent of fraud and of asymmetric information, so that solid issuers with good projects might benefit from less underpricing. Practical implications: The research may help in reducing underpricing, as the authors find that issuers can reduce it by holding a pre-ICO and by considering larger issue sizes. If they do so, investors will get fewer opportunities to benefit from underpricing. Investors can, nevertheless, also profit from the knowledge generated in this paper. When market sentiment is positive and first-day trading volume is expected to be high, investing in ICOs is likely to give them higher first-day returns. Finally, the authors hope that this paper will serve as a basis for further research into the exciting and dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Originality/value: There is hardly any research on underpricing of ICOs. The paper is interesting for its table with a brief comparison of ICOs and IPOs. It also searches for variables from the asymmetric information theory behind IPOs to be applied in explaining ICOs. It shows high levels of ICO underpricing in comparison to IPOs. It also gives suggestions for issuers of (and investors in) ICOs. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	doi = {10.1080/01446193.2022.2056216},
	abstract = {Blockchain represents an evolving technology for distributed and secure recording and sharing of information. Meanwhile, blockchain has thrived in banking, finance, and supply chain; its usage within the construction industry is still in its infancy. To this end, the existing literature falls short in providing comprehensive quantitative understanding, within a systems-based analytic context, of the factors affecting blockchain utilization in construction applications. This paper fills this knowledge gap. The authors: (1) conducted an extensive literature review on blockchain implementation in the construction domain; (2) identified a list of 41 factors affecting blockchain implementation in construction projects categorized in four categories: challenges, needs, requirements, and capabilities; (3) utilized a social network analysis (SNA) approach on a database of 111 publications to quantitatively analyze the literature as related to the aforementioned factors; and (4) performed clustering analysis on the SNA graphs to determine the combinations of factors that are most likely co-occurring in research publications. SNA results indicate that while the most investigated factor was “increased trust and transparency between project parties”, the least studied factors included: “cash upfront funding system”, “change payment processes and procedures”, “smart contracts design errors”, “cryptocurrency fluctuations”, “lack of sufficiently skilled personnel”, and “increased awareness and capabilities of personnel”. Also, clustering outcomes highlight that some combinations of factors are not well-represented in current scholarly efforts. Such imbalance and consequent knowledge gaps may contribute to the actual implementation rate of blockchain in construction applications. Ultimately, this paper provides a roadmap for potential future directions of blockchain construction-related research. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

However, previous publications show that such tokens can be replaced or manipulated in a number of hard-to-detect ways pre- or post-delivery to the user and that implemented (remote) attestation and authenticity checks fail their purpose for multiple reasons. We analyzed the architecture of current products by examining their initialization procedure and attestation methods. Unlike previous publications, we found that tightened attestation and communications encryption will not solve the fundamental architectural flaws sustainably. We conclude that the architecture of current-generation cryptocurrency hardware wallets missed the opportunity for a resilient design by copying the PC's wallet architecture and thus merely shifting the single point of trust from the PC to the hardware wallet. We advocate a mutually verified architecture through changes to BIP32/BIP44 wallet architectures to incorporate collaborative signatures and key generation. This way, neither a compromised wallet nor a compromised PC can meaningfully manipulate keys or transactions. © 2021 Owner/Author.},

	doi = {10.1109/TEM.2020.3032426},
	abstract = {Nowadays, supported by the blockchain technology, initial coin offering (ICO) has emerged as a way to finance projects via crowdfunding. In this article, by building stylized theoretical models, we examine the product development project financing problem under the traditional bank case (Model TBK) and ICO case (Model ICO). Under a commonly used demand function in which product quality scales the price-dependent market demand, we theoretically derive and compare the optimal pricing and quality decisions for the project under both models. We identify the feasible conditions, which govern the feasibility of each financing model. We then develop the optimal rule, in the form of an algorithm, to determine the optimal financing choice. To show the robustness of the results and test the impacts of having a different form of demand function, we examine in the extended models the case when demand function is linear-additive to both price and quality. We find that the major results derived from the main models scenario remain valid in the extended models scenario. Some interesting subtle differences between the two models are also revealed. We conclude by highlighting that the two financing modes (TBK and ICO) are very different and have a substantial impact on the optimal pricing and quality decisions as well as the start-up company's profitability. © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years cryptocurrencies are emerging as a prime digital currency as an important asset and financial system is also emerging as an important aspect. To reduce the risk of investment and to predict price, trend, portfolio construction, and fraud detection some Artificial Intelligence techniques are required. The Paper discusses recent research in the field of AI techniques for cryptocurrency and Bitcoin which is the most popular cryptocurrency. AI and ML techniques such as SVM, ANN, LSTM, GRU, and much other related research work with cryptocurrency and Bitcoin have been reviewed and most relevant studies are discussed in the paper. Also highlighted some possible research opportunities and areas for better efficiency of the results. Recently in the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity have advanced expeditiously. Its implementation has been extensively useful in finance as well as has a crucial impact on markets, institutions, and legislation. It is making the world a better place. AI is responsible for the simulation of machines that are replicas of human beings and are intelligent enough. AI in finance is changing the way we communicate with money. It helps the financial industry streamline and optimize processes from credit judgments to quantitative analysis marketing and economic risk management. The main goal of this research has been investigating certain impacts of artificial intelligence in this contemporary world. It's centered on the appeal of artificial intelligence, confrontation, chances, and its influence on professions and careers. The research paper uses AI to enable banks to generate financial resources and to provide valuable customer services. The application of the growing Indian banking sector is part of everyday life made up of several banks like RBI, SBI, HDFC, etc. and these banks have digitally implemented using chat-bots that have brought benefits to the customers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Today, blockchain technology and its cryptocurrency function are widely proposed as a tool for supply chain finance and some companies already accept cryptocurrency in business transactions. However, supply chain agents may possess different risk attitudes towards the use of cryptocurrency. In this paper, we build stylised analytical three-echelon supply chain models to examine this issue. To be specific, we consider the case in which supply chain agents can be risk neutral, risk averse or risk prone towards the volatile value of cryptocurrency. We model these risk attitudes by using the mean-risk theory. In the main models, comparing the benefits of supply chain agents as well as consumers under the cases with and without blockchain and cryptocurrency, we analytically reveal the impacts brought by risk attitudes of supply chain agents in different echelons. We find the conditions under which implementing blockchain with cryptocurrency achieves an all-win situation for all supply chain agents and consumers. Critical factors which affect the adoption of blockchain with cryptocurrency in supply chains are further investigated. In the extended models, we consider two cases: (i) The case in which “not using blockchain with cryptocurrency” has an impact on consumer utility; and (ii) there is a chain-to-chain competition. We uncover that the main conclusion remains valid and new insights are also derived. © Operational Research Society 2020.},

	doi = {10.1287/mnsc.2021.4225},
	abstract = {This paper highlights two channels through which blockchain-enabled tokenization can alleviate moral hazard frictions between founders, investors, and users of a platform: token financing and decentralized governance. We consider an entrepreneur who uses outside financing and exerts private effort to build a platform and users who decide whether to join in response to the platform’s dynamic transaction fee policy. We first show that raising capital by issuing tokens rather than equity mitigates effort under-provision because the payoff to equity investors depends on profit, whereas the payoff to token investors depends on transaction volume, which is less sensitive to effort. Second, we show that decentralized governance associated with tokenization eliminates a potential holdup of platform users, which in turn alleviates the need to provide users with incentives to join, reducing the entrepreneur’s financing burden. The downside of tokenization is that it puts a cap on how much capital the entrepreneur can raise. Namely, if tokens are highly liquid, that is, they change hands many times per unit of time, their market capitalization is small relative to the net present value (NPV) of the platform profits, limiting how much money one can raise by issuing tokens rather than equity. If building the platform is expensive, this can distort the capacity investment. The resulting tradeoff between the benefits and costs of tokenization leads to several predictions regarding adoption. © 2022 INFORMS.},

	abstract = {Over the last few years, cryptocurrencies have become a new alternative exchange currency for the global economy. Due to the high volatility in the prices of cryptocurrencies, forecasting the price movements is considered a very complicated challenge in the world of finance. Technical analysis indicators are one of the prediction tools which are widely used by analysts. These indicators, which are explored from the historical prices and volumes, might have useful information on price dynamics in the market. Meanwhile, with the new advances in artificial intelligence techniques, like long short-term memory (LSTM), which is able to keep the track of long-term dependencies; there is the extensive application of deep neural networks for predicting nonstationary and nonlinear time series. This study provides a forecasting method for cryptocurrencies by applying an LSTM multi-input neural network to investigate the prediction power of the lags of technical analysis indicators as the inputs to forecast the price returns of the three cryptocurrencies; Bitcoin(BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) that have the highest market capitalization. The results illustrate that the proposed method helps the investors to make more reliable decisions by significantly improving the prediction accuracy against the random walk over the maximum trading time of BTC, ETH, and XRP datasets. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to make the reader aware of recent changes in the white supremacist movement and how such changes have altered the ways in which the movement can be combatted. Design/methodology/approach: The authors study the movement in two periods: from 1970 to 2005 and from 2006 onward. The authors contrast the two periods and discuss the legal and financial issues within each. Findings: The authors find that while legal concepts such as vicarious liability and respondeat superior apply today just as they did before, new tools are needed to fight the new means of financing the movement. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this study is the lack of quantitative data. Because the “alt-right” became popular around 2015, there has not been enough time for the construction of detailed data sets. Practical implications: While many law papers have explored the white supremacist movement, the financing side has gone under-analyzed in scholarly research. This is important in light of the rise of the internet, online payment processors, cryptocurrencies and remote organizing and fundraising. Social implications: The 2017 Charlottesville rally was organized and financed via podcasts, online forums, encrypted chats and anonymous payments. Since then, the movement has mostly gone underground and has become more violent and radical as many members have come to believe that marches and politics do not help them. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there are no papers in finance that deal extensively with this topic. The authors believe that the severity of the issue and the importance of its funding make this study a valuable source of information.

Although this process has become more visible following the pandemic, the dematerialization of money is not a new phenomenon. Over time, money was turned into fiat money, scriptural money, electronic money, and recently to digital money, namely in the context of cryptocurrency market. However, contrary to what would be expected, it was found that the growing trend toward the use of cryptocurrencies has been reversed with the emergence of the pandemic. The comparison between the pre-pandemic and the pandemic period shows the mean growth rates of daily trading volumes for six of the major cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, BitcoinCash, Ripple, and Litecoin) are considerably lower during the pandemic. This situation is particularly evident in the case of Ethereum, which from a mean growth rate of trading volumes of 0.54\% in the pre-pandemic period, recorded during the pandemic a decrease of −0,575\%. Significant drops were also observed in Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Litcoin. Even so, digital payments seem to be the future, namely through the launch of the so-called Central Bank Digital Currency.

However, from the individual consumer side, it is mainly linked to the cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is seen as a subset of alternative currencies from a general perspective and as a subset of digital currencies in a narrow sense. According to Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies 2017, block chain technology is in the peak of inflated expectations stage. There are 5–10 years for maturity and widespread usage. Many consulting firms share the same insight, stating that block chain technology will be a main technological platform by 2025. Blockchain technology is a relatively new area of study mainly analyzed by engineering and finance scholars. There are very few academic studies including the consumers’ standpoint. Analyzing a new business idea or a technological novelty without considering the consumer side will be ungrounded. In this chapter, crypto currencies, specifically Bitcoin and the underlying technology Blockchain, will be studied from the consumer point of view. Awareness of crypto currencies, attitudes toward it, purchase intentions, user profiles, usage motivation around the world and in Turkey will be discussed. Following this section, the adoption of Blockchain technology and Bitcoin adoption will be analyzed by different technology acceptance and adoption models. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously noisy, but not all markets might behave in the exact same way. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate which one of the cryptocurrency markets contributes the most to the common volatility component inherent in the market. Design/methodology/approach: The paper extracts each of the cryptocurrency's markets' latent volatility using a stochastic volatility model and, subsequently, models their dynamics in a fractionally cointegrated vector autoregressive model. The authors use the refinement of Lien and Shrestha (2009, J. Futures Mark) to come up with unique Hasbrouck (1995, J. Finance) information shares. Findings: The authors’ findings indicate that Bitfinex is the leading market for Bitcoin and Ripple, while Bitstamp dominates for Ethereum and Litecoin. Based on the dominant market for each cryptocurrency, the authors find that the volatility of Bitcoin explains most of the volatility among the different cryptocurrencies. Research limitations/implications: The authors’ findings are limited by the availability of the cryptocurrency data. Apart from Bitcoin, the data series for the other cryptocurrencies are not long enough to ensure the precision of the authors’ estimates. Originality/value: To date, only price discovery in cryptocurrencies has been studied and identified. This paper extends the current literature into the realm of volatility discovery. In addition, the authors propose a discrete version for the evolution of a markets fundamental volatility, extending the work of Dias et al. (2018). © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Due to the lack of trust as a result of the 2008 global financial crisis, the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is increasingly thought of as an alternative to the prevailing financial architecture by presenting a technologically more trustworthy alternative. Because of the effect it had due to its number of users, volume, and market size, Bitcoin attracted the attention of the whole world. By using blockchain technology and mining, Bitcoin attempts to replace the services based on trust and the mediation role offered by banks in the traditional finance system. With its characteristics such as low cost, fast transaction times, and low risks, Bitcoin first emerged in 2008 and since then, due to these characteristics, has triggered an important change and transformation. The fact that Bitcoin is used for speculative investment motives, and that the energy used for its mining is made up of conventional energy sources brought a debate about the sustainability and environmental effects of this system. This article evaluates the evolution of money in the era of digital transformation and the repositioning of cryptocurrencies with a focus on Bitcoin.

Whether as a revolution in payment methods, because it is a speculative asset or because of the particularities of the technology on which it is supported, cryptocurrencies are generating a greater impact on our lives, especially in the world of finance. The main objective that we set ourselves is to delve into the knowledge of cryptocurrencies and the technology that supports them, in a way that allows us to have a clear idea of the consequences that their appearance has not only in the financial field, but also in the economy in general. If we make an approximation to these cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, we will be able to be aware of the advantages of their use, as well as the disadvantages of their existence, which will allow us to be aware of the role that this technology can play in the present, in the short term and long term, especially in the business field. After this analysis of the origins of Bitcoin and its evolution, we study its correlation with several assets and indices: Ethereum (second cryptocurrency with the highest value), gold (commodity considered as a refuge value), S\&P500 (the most representative index of the US market) and the MSCI World Index (most representative global index), briefly explaining each of these assets, to finally analyze their correlation with Bitcoin from the year for which we have data for each one. © 2022, Revista de Metodos Cuantitativos para la Economia y la Empresa.

	abstract = {In the modern finance sector, Blockchain (BC) is a widespread theme technology. It is a technology with a distinct combination of features like distributed notes, consensus algorithm, decentralized structure, storage mechanism, smart contracting, and asymmetric encryption for assuring the transparency, visibility, and security of the network. Banks and financial organizations are the key factors in modern society. Thus, security and other terms such as privacy, scalability, and transparency need to be maintained in this sector. In that context, BC is widely used in the financial sector. Though the BC results in various benefits like immutability, security, decentralization, consensus, unanimous, and faster settlement, still it lacks some points on enhancing the financial sectors. It mainly lacks security, maintaining privacy, protection against cybercrime, and energy consumption. Therefore, the study reviewed the waves of BC in the financial sector, along with this the study also presents the application of BC in a financial organization. Followed by this, issues and problems in the BC over financial sectors are also reviewed. The study was performed in a range of supporting future researchers to implement an efficient BC network in the financial sector. © 2023, List-Gesellschaft e.V.},

We then examine the sources of yield and translate those into three example yield farming strategies, followed by the simulations of yield farming performance, based on these strategies. We further compare four major yield aggregators - Idle, Pickle, Harvest and Yearn - in the ecosystem, along with brief introductions of others. We systematize their strategies and revenue models, and conduct an empirical analysis with on-chain data from example vaults, to find a plausible connection between data anomalies and historical events.

We argue conceptually and then empirically document that increased tax scrutiny leads crypto investors to utilize conventional tax planning with tax-loss harvesting as an alternative to non-compliance. In particular, domestic traders increase tax-loss harvesting following the increase in tax scrutiny, and U.S. exchanges exhibit a significantly greater amount of wash trading. Additional findings suggest that broad-based and targeted changes in tax scrutiny can differentially affect crypto traders’ preference for U.S.-based exchanges.

Our results for the overall sample refer to an anti-herding behavior in each model. However, the results of the TV-MS model for the 3rd sub-period (2/28/2017−1/16/2018) imply the existence of a herding behavior in the low volatility regime, an anti-herding behavior occurred during the high volatility regime and the effect of uncertainty was significant on the anti-herding behavior.

This paper incorporates signaling theory and a phase-based view of the ICO process to systematically review 78 empirical studies, published between January 2017 and January 2022, on the conceptualization, theories and determinants of ICO success. The review explores six main determinants of ICO success: the founder, ICO, venture, market, investors, and context. The founder initiates the ICO process by deliberately selecting this method for funding their business and choosing the type and quality of signals that both encourage investors and guide their decision to participate in and support the ICO project in different contexts. Based on this review, we develop a model for ICO success, tracking success determinants in each phase of the ICO process.

In doing so, a total of 197 770 captured posts across social media platforms have been collected and analyzed. The results illustrate that discussions on blockchain technologies dominated the interplay in the first analyzed time period, that discussions on cryptocurrencies and ICOs dominated the interplay in the second analyzed time period, while discussions concerning blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and ICOs highly converge in the third time period. By illustrating this shift over the analyzed time periods and by offering a systematic exploration of key characteristics of the interplay at hand, this article adds to previous literature on entrepreneurial finance by providing an empirical contribution which details the coevolution of these phenomena in recent years. © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This study explores the factors affecting the probability of success of initial coin offerings (ICOs) with a specific focus on the tourism industry. ICOs emerged as a financial technology (FinTech) development and use blockchain technology. As a novel form of crowdfunding, ICOs are public offerings that can be used to raise capital for entrepreneurs and also have the potential to be a new financing method for tourism ventures with financing challenges. Although ICOs can represent a very substantial alternative financing method for today’s innovative business models, the phenomenon seems to be poorly understood. With this in mind, this study highlights the importance of blockchain technology and thus ICOs as an alternative financing tool for the tourism industry. In this context, 49 ICOs that ended between 05 July 2017 and 27 January 2021 were analysed by applying the logistic regression analysis method. The results show that the most essential signals of the probability of success of a tourism ICO are human capital, duration, acceptance of Bitcoin as the most popular cryptocurrency, and bonuses offered as an incentive instrument. The findings have useful practical implications for the determinants of ICOs’ success for both tourism entrepreneurs and contributors of tourism ICOs. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Data-driven volatility models and neuro-volatility models have the potential to revolutionize the area of Computational Finance. Volatility measures the variation of a time series data, and thus it is also a driving factor for the risk forecasting of returns from investment in cryptocurrencies. A cryptocurrency is a decentralized medium of exchange that relies on cryptographic primitives to facilitate the trustless transfer of value between different parties. Instead of being physical money, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries on an online ledger called blockchain that describe specific transactions.Many commonly used risk forecasting models do not take into account the uncertainty associated with the volatility of an underlying asset to obtain the risk forecasts. Some tools from the fuzzy set theory can be incorporated into the forecasting models to account for this uncertainty. Interest in the use of hybrid models for fuzzy volatility forecasts is growing. However, a major drawback is that the fuzzy coefficient hybrid models used in fuzzy volatility forecasts are not data-driven. This paper uses fuzzy set theory with data-driven volatility and data-driven neuro-volatility forecasts to study the fuzzy risk forecasts. The study focuses on long-term volatility forecasts with daily price data while briefly exploring forecasting models with high-frequency (hourly) data as an avenue for future research. Simple yet effective models incorporating fuzziness to obtain fuzzy risk volatility forecasts and fuzzy VaR forecasts are presented. The key underlying idea, unlike the existing risk forecasting, is the use of a hybrid nonlinear adaptive fuzzy model for volatility. © 2022 IEEE.},

Objective: This paper explores whether the Open-source Software Ecosystem Health Operationalization (OSEHO) framework can be used to extend the given technology factors. Method: By conducting the OSEHO in a case-study on three distinct cryptocurrency ecosystems, this paper gives a better insight in the ecosystem’s value, longevity and propensity for growth and the relation of these factors to the cryptocurrency value. Results: The ‘healthiest’ cryptocurrency ecosystem also shows the highest economic health. Two metrics from the OSEHO show strong positive significant correlation with the exchange rate. Conclusion: Metrics from the OSEHO show promising indications to be technological determinants for the exchange rate.

It argues first that theories of money—in particular, the “commodity theory of money” and the “state theory of money”—could provide valuable theoretical insights for the IPE study of cryptocurrencies as money.

	doi = {10.1108/MF-11-2021-0579},
	abstract = {Purpose: In 2004, Roanoke College began offering a Student-Managed Fund course, wherein students were able to manage a portfolio of equity and fixed income using real money. While not a widely adopted concept at the time, it has since become quite common in finance programs, either through courses or clubs. In February 2019, the author supplemented activities in the course with the addition of real cryptoassets for students to manage. The paper discusses the design, implementation, and pedagogical advantages of the fund. Design/methodology/approach: The paper expands on the existing literature regarding student-managed investment funds (SMIFs or SMFs) by presenting a case study on the implementation of a student-managed cryptoasset fund at Roanoke College. Findings: The value of experiential learning through student-managed funds (SMFs) is well established. Thus, these programs have become much more common in recent years and are now often expanding to securities beyond equities and bonds. The introduction of cryptoassets to be traded by students at Roanoke College is another step in improving students' exposure to various markets and appears to further improve research and critical thinking skills. Originality/value: This is certainly one of the first, and to the author's knowledge may be the only, real money cryptoasset fund managed by students. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Firstly, this article describes a general panorama of research involving fintechs from the last 30 years in the subareas ‘Business, Management and Accounting’ and ‘Economics, Econometrics and Finance’. Secondly, we detected three generations of research related to this field of study. They are the discovery (1991-2006), the development (2007-2016), and the expansion (2017-2020). Also, we highlighted connections between the three generations, as well as the evolutionary process of the subjects that were addressed in these different generations. The third result was the identification of six themes that represent research trends for the future, which are: ‘banking \& financial services’, ‘electronic services \& ‘e-finance’, ‘consumer behaviour’, ‘mobile services’, ‘risk’ and ‘cryptocurrency'. © 2022, Universidad Alberto Hurtado.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine the properties of four major cryptocurrencies and how they can be used as a simpler alternative mode of hedging foreign exchange (FX) risks as compared to existing mainstream financial risk management techniques. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a combination of visual data representations and the classic Fama and Macbeth (1973) two-pass procedure regressions. Findings: The findings show that cryptocurrencies can be a more effective hedge against FX risks as compared to other common hedging instruments and/or techniques such as gold or a diversified currency portfolio. Research limitations/implications: The conclusions were arrived at based only on a small group of cryptocurrency, i.e. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple. Other cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin or ZCash might exhibit different properties. Practical implications: Cryptocurrencies can be cost-effective and cost-efficient instruments that provide a solid hedge for investors and/or firms that are exposed to global FX volatility. Its ease of trade and virtually zero barriers to entry makes it an easily accessible alternative hedge instrument as compared to more complex items such as derivatives. Originality/value: If cryptocurrencies are to be accepted into mainstream usage, a detailed examination of its various uses is necessary. In particular, as they are often touted to be the future of currency, its properties and price behavior relative to other mainstream financial instruments need to be well-understood, not only by finance professionals but also by laypersons. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

To address this question, we examine a set of technologies that have received increasing industry, media, and scholarly attention over the past decade: blockchains. Harnessing the concepts of ‘moral economy’ and ‘scandal’, we identify both possibilities and limits for blockchain applications to legitimate a range of monetary and investment activities. However, we also find that a persistent individualisation of responsibility for failures and shortcomings with ‘live’ blockchain experimentation has undermined the potentially legitimating aspects of this technology. Combining a reliance on technological fixes with a persistent individualist moral economy, we conclude, works against efforts to confront head-on the tensions underpinning the on-going legitimacy crises facing finance. © The Author(s)},

Our evidence supports the notion that sentiment plays a role in the investment decision-making process. Traders tend to realise positive returns when sentiment is bullish. Moreover, positive changes in the level of bullishness lead to traders executing larger trades, and a higher probability of depositing and withdrawing funds.

	abstract = {A significant increase in the cash value of Bitcoin in the beginning of 2017 led to growth in people's interest in cryptocurrency. The uniqueness of this type of money is that the transaction occurs only with the approval of a network of participants, and the funds themselves are beyond the control of any state. At the same time, the Russian government, represented by the Ministry of Finance, did not approve a cryptocurrency until 2018. Despite the large number of studies that reveal the main advantages and disadvantages of cryptocurrency, as well as the motivation of the participants, the issue of building trust in cryptocurrencies remains relevant. The main goal of this study is to identify the mechanisms of trust building among the participants of the cryptocurrency market. The research information base was based on 15 semi-structured interviews with active participants of the cryptocurrency market. Based on collected data, a typology of cryptocurrency users was made, and ways of managing risks in interacting with the market and insight into the role of the state in this market were examined. Cryptocurrency users can be divided into those who use it for consumption of various goods (including those who are prohibited in the territory of the Russian Federation) and those who seek to derive financial benefit from the current market situation. Although both groups exist in the same market, they have different expectations: consumers strive to ensure that the cryptocurrency exchange rate remains stable, whereas the other group hopes for a long period of high exchange-rate volatility to increase their own earnings. The position that the local state should take is an important factor of trust for each of the groups represented. Cryptocurrencies are still at an early stage of development. A large group of people on the market is trying to monetize the weaknesses that exist at the moment. Over time, the situation on the cryptocurrency market stabilizes, and it can then move to a qualitatively different stage of development. © 2018 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

Commodities such as cacao seed, salt, and tobacco were used as a medium of exchange. Coins are standard in weight and value which stems from Lydia and brought a rapid civilization to the World. In gold standard and silver standard the value of money was pegged to the value of the metal. Although European Monetary Union is a recent and well-known attempt for countries to accept a single currency, there were earlier attempts such as Latin Monetary Union. There are criticisms on EMU however, leading to ongoing problems such as Brexit. The end of Soviet Union and Yugoslavia are also interesting to analyze monetary consequences. This is an attempt to create a world currency which creates advantages in trade. Under bimetallic standard, money was pegged to the price of gold and silver. Paper money which is inconvertible created inflationary problems. Bretton Woods is an attempt to peg the currency into US Dollar. Currency wars still exist today, which also benefits some countries in trade. Dollarization is the use of US Dollar outside of USA. De-dollarization attempts to trade in currencies other than US Dollar. Banks are important in the use of modern money; however, the issues in money transfer created some alternatives. Digital wallets are less costly and faster when it comes to money transfer. Cryptocurrencies are also available with the help of Blockchain technology.

ICOs help projects to be funded in a short time with a high-profit margin. The primary purpose of this study is isolating the principal factors that affect the decision to invest in an ICO. A large array of potential signals, consisting of promotion and marketing effects, investor motivation, founder team effects, whitepaper and ICO specific factors, are considered in an online survey and the responses are analyzed using Exploratory Factor Analysis. The results of the analysis reveal five composite principal factors that determine the decision to invest in an ICO. These five principal factors are the ICO whitepaper, websites for finance news and ICO listings, ICO project sector and founder, ICO project team and social media. Our findings provide a perspective to both investor and ICO founders about which factors to prioritize when deciding to launch an ICO or to invest in one. © 2020 Sciedu Press.},

	abstract = {Using an analogy between finance and astrophysics, this study aims to investigate whether there exists a mechanism that can describe the explosive increase in the number of traded cryptocurrencies and the cryptocurrency market in general. In physics, the Schwarzschild radius indicates that black holes are constantly expanding because of their mass increase. Enriching this analogy, we consider the cryptocurrency market as a self-gravitational body whose mass is denoted by (1) the number of traded cryptocurrencies and (2) in terms of increasing market capitalization for a given number of traded cryptocurrencies. By analyzing weekly snapshot data of all traded cryptocurrencies from January 4, 2009, to June 14, 2020, we find evidence that the above-mentioned mechanism exists. The results clearly indicate the self-gravitational property of the cryptocurrency market, which is direct evidence toward the hypothesis that the changes in the traded cryptocurrencies are a positive function of the previous period’s number of traded cryptocurrencies. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The paper examines market co-movement between pairs of financial assets in the time-frequency domain. Recent finance literature confirms the integration of cryptocurrencies and financial assets, which may bring more investments with the possibility of surplus liquidity in the cryptocurrency segment, leading to financial instability. The novelty of this paper is examining the integration of cryptocurrencies and the indices of equity, sustainability, renewable energy, and crude oil for the daily observations from 2015 to 2021 by using the wavelet coherency method. The empirical results signify no integration in the short-term scales and grow stronger in the medium-term scales, especially during the COVID-19 period, and further exhibit weaker heterogeneous associations in the long-term scales. However, the sustainability, clean energy indices follow similar dynamics of the equity market and crypto pairs. In contrast, the global crude oil index showcases the minor integration with cryptocurrencies compared with other traditional asset classes. Hence, the cryptocurrency market fails to confirm the safe haven features, especially during the COVID-19 periods (Medium-term), which facilitate the domestic and international investors expecting to hedge their price risk in equity markets using cryptocurrencies may have to look for short-term. The lead–lag heterogeneous effects of the asset-pairs may pave arbitrage opportunities for investors. © 2023 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

Design/Methodology/Approach: This study employs a structured questionnaire to solicit data about the accounting treatments for cryptocurrency. Data were collected from 391 accounting and finance professionals and analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Research findings: The results of this study show that technological factors, risks and regulatory frameworks are positively associated with the accounting treatments for cryptocurrency. Theoretical contribution/Originality: This study has expanded the existing literature by focusing on the accounting treatments for cryptocurrency using the accounting conceptual framework as the theoretical argument. Practitioner/Policy implication: The findings imply that audit, tax and accounting professionals need to address the valuation and reporting of different classes and types of cryptocurrencies as their usage continue to rise. The core competencies of these professions are being disrupted by these changes; hence, these professions need to evolve and work with strategic partners/technology experts to offer cryptocurrency related advisory services. Research limitation/Implications: The researchers consider three factors namely technological, risks and regulatory frameworks that influence the accounting treatments for cryptocurrency. Future researchers may consider working with industry leaders to develop objective guidelines for cryptocurrencies, using comparative analysis of alternative accounting treatments to examine how this impacts financial results. © 2021, University of Malaya.

	abstract = {We consider a continuous-time financial market with no arbitrage and no transactions costs. In this setting, we introduce two types of perpetual contracts, one in which the payoff to the long side is a fixed function of the underlyers and the long side pays a funding rate to the short side, the other in which the payoff to the long side is a fixed function of the underlyers times a discount factor that changes over time but no funding payments are required. Assuming asset prices are continuous and strictly positive, we derive model-free expressions for the funding rate and discount rate of these perpetual contracts as well as replication strategies for the short side. When asset prices can jump, we derive expressions for the funding and discount rates, which are semirobust in the sense that they do not depend on the dynamics of the volatility process of the underlying risky assets, but do depend on the intensity of jumps under the market's pricing measure. When asset prices can jump and the volatility process is independent of the underlying risky assets, we derive an explicit replication strategy for the short side of a perpetual contract. Throughout the paper, we illustrate through examples how specific perpetual contracts relate to traditional financial instruments such as variance swaps and leveraged exchange traded funds. © 2023 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

However, there was a low acceptance of these technologies among consumers. There is a clear gap in-between that has not yet been taken into consideration and has been misunderstood on many platforms. This paper intends to estimate the usability of blockchain technology by investigating behavioral elements that affect customers' intention towards blockchain-based cryptocurrency transactions. Given the complexity of the technology, this study proposes a new integration model: The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) together with new external variables regarding blockchain adoption characteristics such as trust, regulatory support, social influence, design, and experience. Surveys were conducted among international users to identify the impacts of these variables on their intention. Our findings indicate two powerful constructs (regulatory support and experience) that encourage customer trust towards blockchain-based applications. People surveyed agreed on a great sense of security and can trust the Blockchain-based applications when they are regulated and insured by the local government. Also, at a certain level of experience, users feel confident to use blockchain-based applications, a high level of trust supports technology adoption. As such, governments and businesses can dedicate efforts to enhance customers' trust and ultimately promote better acceptance of blockchain technology and its applications. © 2020},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a high-level analysis of the intersection emerging cryptocurrency sector with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations and risk-based AML diligence systems maintained by financial institutions. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis begins with a description of cryptocurrencies, focusing specifically on how the supporting technologies and applications increase vulnerabilities. The information will lay the foundation for examining the vulnerabilities existing in the architecture of cryptocurrency technology, as well as potential targets for regulations. The second part of the analysis will then shift focus to defining the scope of the money laundering problem associated with cryptocurrencies. An in-depth understanding of the problem is necessary to inform tailored AML legislation and regulations. The third part of the analysis will explore emerging AML regulations that govern cryptocurrencies, focusing specifically on those being developed and implemented in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE regulations will then be compared to those of the USA and European Union (EU) for comparative analysis and best practices. Findings: The UAE has a robust legal system aimed at bolstering AML efforts while supporting widespread integration of crypto assets into business and government operations. A review of the UAE’s legislative framework reveals critical issues. First, the current regulations do not cover decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The absence of clear regulations for DeFi and NFT protocols has created a leeway for money laundering and related criminal activities. Second, there is a high level of fragmentation in the UAE’s legislative landscape. The UAE does not have uniform, national laws that apply to all the Emirates. Fragmentation is not unique to the UAE but a major global problem that affects the USA and EU. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt a tailored approach where standard rules and regulations are responsive to the diverse aspects of cryptocurrencies. The strategy is vital, as it will be impractical to create a single legislation or law that will cover all the crypto assets, including their diverse applications. Furthermore, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) should develop a global standard that will support a unified/harmonized application of AML/counter-terrorist financing (CTF) laws and regulations related to cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology. Originality/value: The borderless nature of digital currency and exchanges means that the existing laws and regulations are inadequate to address cross-border money laundering activities. Thus, there is an urgent need of harmonizing global regulations to ensure uniformity in applications. The quest for harmonization should be a priority as the FATF works towards developing a global standard. The global standard will support a uniform application of AML/CTF laws and regulations related to cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Financial innovation and technological advances are growing at a pace unrivalled by any other period in history. However, as more stakeholders enter these markets, criminals are exploiting their inadvertent security deficiencies to launder illicit funds or finance terrorism. This three-round policy Delphi study involved consultations with 52 experts from different industries and countries to understand future risk-prone technological developments, possible prevention measures and relevant stakeholders. Results highlight a range of money laundering and terrorist financing risks being enabled by advances in distributed ledger technologies (predominantly through cryptocurrencies), new payment methods and financial technology (FinTech). These threats include privacy-enhanced cryptoassets, transaction laundering, e-currencies and digital-only financial services. Findings also suggest that detection-based countermeasures (currently the primary preventative approach) can be coupled with more diverse countermeasures to increase effectiveness. However, the unique circumstances and constraints specific to different stakeholders will affect the nature, utility, and extent to which they can implement certain countermeasures. As such, a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to prevention is undesirable. Drawing on expert insight from the study, we propose a framework and a 3-point standard of implementation to motivate cost-effective, user-friendly, and innovation-friendly measures to improve suspicious activity detection and futureproof technologies before their criminal exploitation becomes mainstream. © 2022},

The question is whether it has a role in reconciling cryptocurrency in Islamic finance. The second is to introduce the new Islamic cryptocurrency to serve these rich Islamic populaces. The study used a qualitative research approach by conducting interviews to explore the Islamic scholars’ views on the framework of the new Islamic cryptocurrency. The scholars have been deemed to meet particular requirements of having comprehensive knowledge and have extensive experience in both the Islamic Shariah and cryptocurrency. Accordingly, the number of such scholars was limited, and eventually, with the access offered only to five scholars from different Islamic countries. We thoroughly analyzed the collected data from the interviews. The findings reveal that Islamic law is absent on the essential models for the conventional cryptocurrency utilization(such as bitcoin) as either a legitimate or illicit apparatus exchange device. Consequently, introducing new Islamic cryptocurrencies is to reconcile cryptocurrencies such as GOLDX and OneGram. They will play a vital role in attracting more than 1.5 billion Muslims around the globe to enter the world of cryptocurrency. © 2021, University of Rijeka. All rights reserved.},

	doi = {10.1108/IJOA-02-2023-3623},
	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to investigate the impact of financial and behavioural factors on investment decisions in the cryptocurrency market within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Design/methodology/approach: The study uses the cross-sectional absolute deviation methodology developed by Chang et al. (2000) to determine the existence of herding behaviour during extreme conditions in the cryptocurrency market of four GCC countries: Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and UAE. In addition, a questionnaire survey was distributed to 322 investors from the GCC cryptocurrency markets to gather data on their investment decisions. Findings: The study finds that the herding theory, prospect theory and heuristics theory account for 16.5\% of the variance in investors' choices in the GCC cryptocurrency market. The regression analysis results show no multicollinearity problems, and a high F-statistic indicates the general model's acceptability in the results. Practical implications: The study's findings suggest that behavioural and financial factors play a significant role in investors' choices in the GCC cryptocurrency market. The study's results can be used by investors to better understand the impact of these factors on their investment decisions and to develop more effective investment strategies. In addition, the study's findings can be used by policymakers to develop regulations that consider the impact of behavioural and financial factors on the GCC cryptocurrency market. Originality/value: This study adds to the body of literature in two different ways. Initially, motivated by earlier research examining the impact of behaviour finance factors on investment decisions, the authors look at how the behaviour finance factors affect investment decisions of the GCC cryptocurrency market. To extend most of these studies, this study uses a regime-switching model that accounts for two different market states. Second, by considering the recent crisis and more recent periods involving more cryptocurrencies, the authors have contributed to several studies examining the impact of behavioural financial factors on investment decisions in cryptocurrency markets. In fact, very few studies have examined the impact of behavioural finance on cryptocurrency markets. Therefore, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first of its kind to investigate how behavioural finance factors influence investment decisions in the GCC cryptocurrency market. This allows to better illuminate the factors driving herd behaviour in the GCC cryptocurrency market. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The cryptocurrency market has received immense consideration in media and academia since the beginning of 2013 because of its huge price fluctuation. This study focuses on Arab investors who invest in the cryptocurrency market by investigating the influence of behavioral finance factors on investment decisions in the cryptocurrency market. A quantitative approach was used by employing a snowball sampling method through 112 questionnaires. The results show that herding theory, prospect theory, and heuristic theory have a significant effect on investors’ investment decisions in the cryptocurrency market. This emphasizes the significant role of the proposed behavioral factors as determinants of the investors’ investment decisions. This study contributes to the existing research by consolidating the results of different researches in this study. It also contributes to the investors’ understanding of the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market and it enhances the ability to make informed decisions based on their understanding. The implication of the findings will prepare hit and run investors to be progressively prepared to stay in the cryptocurrency market and develop their abilities on the most proficient method to settle on sound venture choices. Furthermore, the findings of this study will encourage financial specialists to realize that information on the traditional finance theory is not adequate to excel in the cryptocurrency market. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

Studying the structure of this graph is essential for understanding the structural properties of the application it represents. Well-known examples of applying this approach are the Internet graph, the Web graph, and the Call graph. It turns out that the degree distributions of all these graphs can be described by the power-law model. Here we consider another important application—a network representation of the stock market. Stock markets generate huge amounts of data, which can be used for constructing the market graph re ecting the market behavior. We conduct the statistical analysis of this graph and show that it also follows the power-law model. Moreover, we detect cliques and independent sets in this graph. These special formations have a clear practical interpretation, and their analysis allows one to apply a new data mining technique of classifying ÿnancial instruments based on stock prices data, which provides a deeper insight into the internal structure of the stock market.},

In particular in the case of planar filtered graphs (genus equal to 0), triangular loops and four-element cliques are formed. The application of this filtering procedure to 100 stocks in the U.S. equity markets shows that such loops and cliques have important and significant relationships with the market structure and properties.},

The second technique is to judge the strength of a connection by its survival rate, which is the amount of time a connection between two stock market indices endures. The idea is that true connections will survive for longer periods of time, and that random connections will not. That information is then combined with the information obtained from the first technique in order to create a smaller network, in which most of the connections are either strong or enduring in time.},

It has also been emphasized that the relevance of these networks relies on the representation of changes follow on the occurrence of stress events. Here, from series of interbank liabilities and claims over different time periods, we have developed networks of positions (net claims) between countries. Besides the Minimal Spanning Tree analysis of the time-constrained networks, a coefficient of residuality is defined to capture the structural evolution of the network of cross-border financial linkages. Because some structural changes seem to be related to the role that countries play in the financial context, networks of debtor and creditor countries are also developed. Empirical results allows to relate the network structure that emerges in the last years to the globally turbulent period that has characterized financial systems since the latest nineties. The residuality coefficient highlights an important modification acting in the financial linkages across countries in the period 1997–2011, and situates the recent financial crises as replica of a larger structural change going on since 1997.},

The model applies correlation networks to Shapley values so that Artificial Intelligence predictions are grouped according to the similarity in the underlying explanations. The empirical analysis of 15,000 small and medium companies asking for credit reveals that both risky and not risky borrowers can be grouped according to a set of similar financial characteristics, which can be employed to explain their credit score and, therefore, to predict their future behaviour.},

Our study reveals that the inverse of the largest eigenvalue of the non-backtracking matrix of the graph often provides a tight lower bound for true percolation threshold. However, in more than 40\% of the cases, this indicator is less predictive than the naive expectation value based solely on the moments of the degree distribution. We find that the performance of all indicators becomes worse as the value of the true percolation threshold grows. Thus, none of them represents a good proxy for robustness of extremely fragile networks.},

For a better risk management, we clean the correlation matrix by removing the market mode from data and then construct this matrix based on the residuals. We show that this technique has an important effect on correlation coefficient distribution by applying it for Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). To study the topological structure of a network we apply the removing market mode technique and the threshold method to Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) as an example. We show that this network follows a power-law model in certain intervals. We also show the behavior of clustering coefficients and component numbers of this network for different thresholds.

Several techniques have been developed and successfully applied for certain application domains. However, this work demands professional knowledge and expert experience. And sometimes it has to resort to the brute-force search. Therefore, if an efficient hyperparameter optimization algorithm can be developed to optimize any given machine learning method, it will greatly improve the efficiency of machine learning. In this paper, we consider building the relationship between the performance of the machine learning models and their hyperparameters by Gaussian processes. In this way, the hyperparameter tuning problem can be abstracted as an optimization problem and Bayesian optimization is used to solve the problem. Bayesian optimization is based on the Bayesian theorem. It sets a prior over the optimization function and gathers the information from the previous sample to update the posterior of the optimization function. A utility function selects the next sample point to maximize the optimization function. Several experiments were conducted on standard test datasets. Experiment results show that the proposed method can find the best hyperparameters for the widely used machine learning models, such as the random forest algorithm and the neural networks, even multi-grained cascade forest under the consideration of time cost.},

	abstract = {Several recent advances to the state of the art in image classiﬁcation benchmarks have come from better conﬁgurations of existing techniques rather than novel approaches to feature learning. Traditionally, hyper-parameter optimization has been the job of humans because they can be very efﬁcient in regimes where only a few trials are possible. Presently, computer clusters and GPU processors make it possible to run more trials and we show that algorithmic approaches can ﬁnd better results. We present hyper-parameter optimization results on tasks of training neural networks and deep belief networks (DBNs). We optimize hyper-parameters using random search and two new greedy sequential methods based on the expected improvement criterion. Random search has been shown to be sufﬁciently efﬁcient for learning neural networks for several datasets, but we show it is unreliable for training DBNs. The sequential algorithms are applied to the most difﬁcult DBN learning problems from [1] and ﬁnd signiﬁcantly better results than the best previously reported. This work contributes novel techniques for making response surface models P (y{\textbar}x) in which many elements of hyper-parameter assignment (x) are known to be irrelevant given particular values of other elements.},

	title = {Random {Search} for {Hyper}-{Parameter} {Optimization}},
	abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efﬁcient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to conﬁgure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks conﬁgured by a pure grid search, we ﬁnd that random search over the same domain is able to ﬁnd models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search ﬁnds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising conﬁguration space. Compared with deep belief networks conﬁgured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional conﬁguration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for conﬁguring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent “High Throughput” methods achieve surprising success—they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

	abstract = {With the popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) and its integration into every field, it has yielded positive results that have increased productivity and aided us in solving complex problems. Deep learning (DL) is a subset of AI developed to mimic the human brain. It is a way for a computer to perform actions that come naturally to humans. It is a tool extensively used to organize unsupervised or unlabeled data and find patterns in them. DL has had a major impact on the field of medical science owing to its applications in medical drug discovery, medical imaging, genome synthesis, disease diagnosis, and much more. The growth of DL in this field has increased significantly owing to the processing and type of data used in the models. Focusing on the type of data, preexisting or curated, can drastically affect the success rate of a DL model. DL is used to diagnose diseases such as skin lesions, brain disease, and chronic disease. To understand the application of DL in disease diagnosis and how it has become one of the most efficient methods for disease diagnosis, this chapter will examine the different architectures of DL, such as convolutional neural networks, feed forward networks, and recurrent neural networks, and how their diagnosing methods compare with traditional disease diagnosis methods. In addition, it will explore advantages and disadvantages of DL compared with traditional methods by comparing various efficiency parameters such as accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, area under the curve, and receiver operating characteristics curve, showing how DL is more effective and produces better results. However, DL faces numerous obstacles. If these are overcome, it will lead to even better results and complete autonomous disease diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Abstract The inherent complex nature of current distributed computing architectures hinders the widespread adoption of these systems for mainstream use. In general, users have access to a highly heterogeneous set of compute resources, which may include clusters, grids, desktop grids, clouds, and other compute platforms. This heterogeneity is especially problematic when running parallel and distributed applications. Software is needed which easily combines as many resources as possible into one coherent computing platform. In this paper, we introduce Zorilla: peer-to-peer (P2P) middleware that creates a single distributed environment from any available set of compute resources. Zorilla imposes minimal requirements on the resource used, is platform independent, and does not rely on central components. In addition to providing functionality on bare resources, Zorilla can exploit locally available middleware. Zorilla explicitly supports distributed and parallel applications, and allows resources from multiple sites to cooperate in a single computation. Zorilla makes extensive use of both virtualization and P2P techniques. We will demonstrate how virtualization and P2P combine into a simple design, while enhancing functionality and ease of use. Together, these techniques bring our goal a step closer: transparent, easy use of resources, even on very heterogeneous distributed systems. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Abstract Federal energy regulatory commission (FERC) Order \#2222 prescribes that distributed energy resources (DERs) with 100 kW or more capacity in aggregate should be allowed to participate in organized electricity markets. Most aggregation is via a combination of disparate DER technologies such as solar, wind, storage, electric vehicles, and smart load units. Another stumbling block to enabling participation of DERs in organized electricity markets is the energy limitation. However, there is a lack of aggregator models in the literature that gainfully allow aggregation of disparate DER technologies that are energy limited. To address this shortcoming, we proposed a disparate DER aggregator (DDA) planning model here, that overcomes energy limitation of DERs. The DDA planning model considers multiple revenue streams of (1) capacity credits; (2) energy revenues; and (3) ancillary services revenues. The proposed DDA planning model enables disparate DER technologies to collate and provide a firm power capacity and participate in the market capacity auction and receive capacity credits. This comprehensive DDA planning model considers the dynamic/temporary aggregations with other facilities through peer-to-peer (P2P) trade, and maximization of the net present value (NPV) revenues over the planning horizon. The developed model is tested on sample and practical large-scale case studies. Additional sensitivity analyses are performed, demonstrating the favourable performance and the business potential of the developed DDA planning model.},

Within the manufacturing arena, academics use the term ?task interdependence? to describe the manner in which different business units are reliant on one another during the production phase. This chapter contains a table that outlines the dependencies and interdependencies for the P2P process by the three main components: procurement, receiving, and accounts payable.

	abstract = {SUMMARYAs peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing systems revolve around cooperation, the design of upload incentives has been one of the most important topics in P2P research for more than a decade. Several deployed systems, such as private BitTorrent communities, successfully manage to foster cooperation by banning peers when their sharing ratio becomes too low. Interestingly, recent measurements have shown that such systems tend to have an oversupply instead of an undersupply of bandwidth designers that have been obsessed with since the dawn of P2P. In such systems, the ?selfish peer? problem is finally solved, but a new problem has arisen: because peers have to keep up their sharing ratios, they now have to compete to upload. In this paper, we explore this new problem and show how even highly cooperative peers might in the end not survive the upload competition. On the basis of recent measurements of over half a million peers in private P2P communities, we propose and analyze several algorithms for uploader selection under oversupply. Our algorithms enable sustained sharing ratio enforcement and are easy to implement in both existing and new systems. Overall, we offer an important design consideration for the new generation of P2P systems in which selfishness is no longer an issue. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We find that as peer-to-peer lenders proliferate, there is increased financial instability, lower GDP and higher unemployment. On the other hand, peer-to-peer lending increases the total volume of loans given out but demonstrates a preference towards consumer loans (over corporate loans), which has a negative effect in the long run. Finally, introducing peer-to-peer lenders increases the access of the unbanked to services which conventional banking is not able to offer within the extant regulatory framework.

Using panel-structured data from a leading P2P lending portal in China, we investigate the effects of venture capital (VC) investment on the performance of P2P lending platforms. Specifically, we identify a short-term signaling effect and a long-term governance effect of VC investment on platform performance in terms of transaction volume, and numbers of lenders and borrowers. However, we only find a decrease in average interest rates after venture capitalists? (VCs?) entry in the long run. Moreover, we verify both the effects of investment from listed VCs, but no signaling effect and a weak governance effect of investment from non-listed VCs. Our analysis provides new insights into how VC investment improves the performance of target firms.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: What is the impact of bankruptcy risk on whether listed corporations are likely to be bought out by private equity firms and on the subsequent exit, including bankruptcy, of private equity backed public to private buyouts? Research Findings/Insights: Using a sample of 246 UK companies that went from public to private (P2P) company status from 1997 to 2005, we find that companies going private have a significantly higher default probability. Private equity firms sponsoring P2P deals acquire firms with a higher risk of bankruptcy than non-acquired firms that remain public. We find evidence that high receivership risk at going private increases the chance that the target will end up in receivership, but post-P2P bankruptcy likelihood is less when the P2P is a management buyout rather than any other form of buyout. Independent boards of pre-P2P targets promote P2P deals and reduce the chances of bankruptcy after the buyout, suggesting a good corporate governance structure makes a positive contribution to bankruptcy avoidance after going private transactions. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our finding that P2P deals involve targets with a higher risk of bankruptcy adds to theoretical insights about private equity. In contrast to previous research, it suggests that PE firms are not deterred by the risk of financial distress but consider it a value creating opportunity. Our use of the option pricing framework represents a first and novel attempt at measuring bankruptcy risk and its impact on the ability of private equity firms to achieve effective turnaround. We find a link between better governance of the target pre-P2P and lower bankruptcy risk since where the PE investor inherits a strong governance structure, manifested in independent boards, chances of subsequent bankruptcy are reduced. Similarly, where the P2P acquisition is a management buyout, the probability of bankruptcy, post-P2P, is reduced, suggesting lower informational asymmetries and better alignment of interests between managerial and private equity investors. Although, due to the small number of receivership exits in our sample of P2P firms, the results are not as strong as we would like, a more extended analysis involving a larger sample over a longer period, in particular of firms exiting through bankruptcy is expected to produce stronger results. Our results provide a sufficient basis to warrant such further analysis. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Private equity backed P2Ps of listed corporations with high bankruptcy risk augment the market for corporate control as they provide an alternative purchaser to traditional acquirers. Our finding that high bankruptcy risk at going private increases the chance the target will end up in receivership suggests a need for caution on the part of private equity firms since the turnaround of P2P targets appears to depend on how seriously distressed they are at the P2P stage. Private equity firms therefore need to engage in careful due diligence. Private equity firms need to give attention to the nature of the pre-P2P governance regime when selecting P2P targets, in particular the extent to which better monitoring by independent directors has been in place and where there is greater alignment of interests between managers and LBO sponsors since these contribute to bankruptcy avoidance. For listed corporations, our findings suggest that strengthening of independent boards may contribute to timely decisions to sell troubled corporations.},

This paper uses unique data from Renrendai, a leading platform in China, to test the influence of video information on P2P lending behavior. Results suggest that, first, the lower the borrower's credit rating is, the more likely they are to provide video information. Second, compared to the video-information-absent borrowers, the otherwise borrowers can get easier access to a loan and offer a lower interest rate. These results indicate that compared to text messages, video information can increase the borrower's creditworthiness and reduce the transaction risk. Thereupon seeing is important in online P2P lending. Third, when the borrower's credit rating is lower, the video effect is significant. The study makes sense in terms of the enrichment of P2P lending literature and the enlightenment on decision-making of both lenders and borrowers.},

The present paper proposes an actuarial modeling based on conditional mean risk sharing, to support the development of this new P2P insurance offer under each of the three business models. In addition, several specific questions are also addressed in the self-governing model. Considering an economic agent who has to select the optimal pool for a risk to be shared with other participants, it is shown that uniform comparison of the Lorenz or concentration curves associated to the respective total losses of the pools under consideration allows the agent to decide which pool is preferable.},

We leverage insights from the literature on psychological distancing and affective intensity to argue that linguistic styles, as the manifestation of social psychological distance, have a negative impact on P2P funding success. Testing our arguments with data from a major Chinese P2P platform, we find that using too many ?you? and negations (proxies for social psychological distance) in the borrower's description will dampen a lender's willingness to support a funding campaign. Moreover, when the social psychological distance is large, language intensity can be perceived as desperate, making a lender even less willing to support the funding campaign. Our research shed new light on the role of language in P2P funding success and has practical implications for lenders, borrowers and regulators in overcoming barriers in P2P lending.},

	abstract = {Summary The rapidly growing cloud computing paradigm provides a cost-effective platform for storing, sharing, and delivering data and computation through internet connectivity. However, one of the biggest barriers for massive cloud adoption is the growing cybersecurity threats/risks that influence its confidence and feasibility. Existing threat models for clouds may not be able to capture complex attacks. For example, an attacker may combine multiple security vulnerabilities into an intelligent, persistent, and sequence of attack behaviors that will continuously act to compromise the target on clouds. Hence, new models for detection of complex and diversified network attacks are needed. In this article, we introduce an effective threat modeling approach that has the ability to predict and detect the probability of occurrence of various security threats and attacks within the cloud environment using hidden Markov models (HMMs). The HMM is a powerful statistical analysis technique and is used to create a probability matrix based on the sensitivity of the data and possible system components that can be attacked. In addition, the HMM is used to provide supplemental information to discover a trend attack pattern from the implicit (or hidden) raw data. The proposed model is trained to identify anomalous sequences or threats so that accurate and up-to-date information on risk exposure of cloud-hosted services are properly detected. The proposed model would act as an underlying framework and a guiding tool for cloud systems security experts and administrators to secure processes and services over the cloud. The performance evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach to find attack probability and the number of correctly detected attacks in the presence of multiple attack scenarios.},

	abstract = {Abstract Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is facing severe information asymmetry problems and depends highly on the internal credit scoring system. This paper provides a novel credit scoring model, which forecasts the probability of default for each applicant and guides the lenders' decision-making in P2P lending. The proposal is expected to improve the existing credit scoring models in P2P lending from two aspects, namely the classifier and the usage of narrative data. We utilize an advanced gradient boosting decision tree technique (i.e., CatBoost) to predict default loans. Moreover, a soft information extraction technique based on keyword clustering is developed to compensate for the insufficient hard credit data. Validated on three real-world datasets, the experimental results demonstrate that variables extracted from narrative data are powerful features, and the utilization of narrative data significantly improves the predictability relative to solely using hard information. The results of sensitivity analysis reveal that CatBoost outperforms the industry benchmark under different cluster numbers of extracted soft information; meanwhile a small number of clusters (e.g., three) is preferred for consideration of model performance, computational cost, and comprehensibility. We finally facilitate a discussion on practical implication and explanatory considerations.},

We find that the credit rating constructed by the BigTech lender is informative of the customers' default risk. Moreover, the interest rate decreases and the credit limit increases with the credit rating. Interestingly, the BigTech lender charges different interest rates to its customers based on the customer channel, although it does not provide information about the customers' default risk. Following the passage of the China Banking Regulatory Commission Act, which reduced credit market competition, the BigTech lender increased the current rate and decreased the credit limit. We rationalize these empirical findings in a simple model of credit contract design.},

	abstract = {Abstract Peer to peer systems are bringing Windows-based computers onto the Internet as full participants. Peer to peer systems utilize the connectivity and capacity to share resources offered by the Internet without being bound by the constraints imposed by the domain name system. Peer to peer (P2P) systems are so named because each computer has the same software as the other?every computer is a peer. In contrast, an application on a server is far more powerful than the client that accesses the server. Peer computers are fundamentally equals. In the history of the network, computation has cycled, from distributed on the desktop to concentrated in one centralized location. Peer to peer systems are at the decentralized end of the continuum. P2P systems utilize the processing power or data storage capacities at the end points of the Internet. The fundamental basis of P2P is cooperation. Therefore P2P systems require trust. Cooperation is required to share any resource, whether it be two children splitting chocolate cake or two million people sharing files. Discussions of P2P therefore require some discussion of trust and security. P2P systems are powerful because they are able to leverage computers that are not consistently identified by domain name or IP address, are not always connected to the network, have highly variable processing power when connected, and are not designed to have particular server capabilities other than that provided by the peering network. The systems are built to withstand high uncertainty and therefore can accept contributions from anyone with a connection, even a modem. After considering the generic issues of P2P systems specific systems are described: Napster, SETI @home, Gnutella, Freenet, Publius, and Kazaa. Limewire and Morpheus are implementations of Gnutella. Rougher introductions are provided for commercial peer to peer systems Groove and Tenix. The specific systems are used to illustrate problems of coordination and trust. Coordination includes naming and searching. Trust includes security, privacy, and accountability (J. L. Camp, ).},

This paper studies the SC financing problem of a capital-constrained SME entrepreneur under two alternative financing schemes provided by an online P2P lending-investment platform, namely debt financing (DF) and equity financing (EF). Considering the competition between a local and a foreign SC in a shared market, we investigate the direct (i.e., subsidizing domestic production) and indirect (i.e., subsidizing P2P platform service fee) roles of government intervention toward SC localization. Formulating a three-level Stackelberg game model, this paper presents a scenario-based decision-making framework to jointly evaluate four different SCF scenarios through the lens of local SC, P2P financing platforms, and government. The results reveal that there exist three possible regions (i.e., DF, EF, and Conflict), within which the government and the P2P financing platforms can examine the alternative SCF schemes in order to achieve a mutually agreeable agreement. Our sensitivity analysis on interest rate and exchange ratio suggests that, when financed via an online P2P lending platform (i.e., DF), the local SC always achieves a higher profit under the direct intervention policy. The indirect policy, however, is preferred only when EF is the main source of SCF and the exchange ratio is sufficiently high.},

Yield curves and forward rate models play the role of arbitrage-free from current to future time models. This chapter highlights that using arbitrage-free models reduces the complexity in applying financial analysis; it also aligns with the expected behavior of investors, which is to avoid risk whenever possible. There are two main views in looking at and analyzing markets. The first point of view is based on the risk neutral concept serving the need of applying arbitrage risk-free in the discounting process and pricing financial instruments.

PCs are still the preferred technology for online shopping in the United Kingdom but the continued growth of mobile commerce (MC) is highly correlated with the success of remote MPs (RMPs). Currently MP research has largely ignored the variations between different MP solutions, and existing MP adoption studies have predominantly utilized Davis? (1989) Technology Acceptance Model, which has been criticized for having a deterministic approach without much consideration for users? individual characteristics. Therefore, this study applied the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), extended with more consumer-related constructs, to explore the factors affecting nonusers? intentions to adopt RMP in the United Kingdom. Quantitative data were collected (n = 268) and structural equation modeling was undertaken. The findings revealed that performance expectancy, social influence, innovativeness, and perceived risk significantly influenced nonusers? intentions to adopt RMP, whereas effort expectancy did not. Inclusion of MP knowledge as a moderating variable revealed that there was a significant difference in the effect of trust on behavioral intention for those who knew about MP than for those who did not. These findings have important theoretical and practical implications, particularly for the development and marketing of RMP, which will support the long-term success of MC.},

We analytically derive the optimal interest rates of the bank and the e-commerce platform and the optimal order quantity of the retailer. Compared with the nonfinancing case, we characterize the regions of the interest rates charged by the bank and the e-commerce platform under which Pareto improvement can be achieved. We also present the retailer's financing preference under equilibrium and show how the initial capital affects the retailer's financing selection. Numerical examples demonstrate that the retailer's order quantity and expected profit increase with the bank's loan ratio.},

	abstract = {Abstract Online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has emerged as an innovative financial technology (FinTech) platform that renders financial services that are potentially more inclusive and affordable than those offered by traditional financial institutions. A similar purpose is served by cryptocurrency markets, where transaction costs are reduced and financial accessibility is improved based on disruptive technologies such as blockchain and distributed ledgers. Despite these developments, however, in the operations management literature limited attention has been devoted to the contribution of online P2P lending to the promotion of financial inclusion (i.e., the availability and usage of financial services for all groups of people) and its dynamic interplay with cryptocurrency markets. The rise of cryptocurrency markets affects the composition and activity of borrowers and investors in P2P lending markets and hence the capacity of the latter to support financial inclusion, leading to an operations management challenge in online P2P lending. We examine how cryptocurrency markets influence P2P lending markets' democratization of access to financial services, particularly P2P borrowing. To investigate these effects in depth, we develop a simple theoretical model to derive testable propositions, which are then empirically validated on the basis of unique data sets. We find that the growth in cryptocurrency markets is associated with increased loan requests and larger loan amounts in P2P markets, especially from borrowers who maintain good credit ratings, possess technical knowledge about cryptocurrencies, and intend to borrow for investment purposes. Our results suggest that cryptocurrency markets bring economic gains to the P2P lending market, at least in the short term. Nonetheless, the transfer of funds from P2P lending to cryptocurrency markets, particularly by highly creditworthy and tech-savvy investors, may provoke increased inequality in access to P2P lending markets. By scrutinizing the interdependence between two representative FinTech markets we uncover important operations management implications for theory and practice regarding the healthy growth and effective governance of crowdfunding platforms and the corresponding sustainability of their role in upholding financial inclusion.},

The chapter then point outs promises of FinTech business models, such as streamlining the user experience and digital integration, setting standards in which the financial industry previously failed, using existing networks at marginal cost, and providing a worse service to customers at a lower price. Pitfalls of FinTech are overestimating data science, overestimating the value of transaction data, overestimating people's trust in technology companies, and underestimating regulatory consequences of flouting the rules.},

Crowdfunding has changed how films are financed in China. Online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is the practice where ordinary consumers lend directly to individuals and small businesses using online platforms, without using a traditional financial intermediary such as a bank.

Deep learning has received much attention in recent years, but it has not been implemented so intensively in credit scoring compared to other financial domains. In this article, stacked unidirectional and bidirectional LSTM (long short-term memory) networks as a complex area of deep learning are applied in solving credit scoring problems for the first time. The proposed robust model exploits the full potential of the three-layer stacked LSTM and BDLSTM (bidirectional LSTM) architecture with the treatment and modeling of public datasets in a novel way since credit scoring is not a time sequence problem. Attributes of each loan instance were transformed into a sequence of the matrix with a fixed sliding window approach with a one-time step. Our proposed models outperform existing and much more complex deep learning solutions thus we succeeded in preserving simplicity. In this article, measures of different types are employed to carry out consistent conclusions. The results by applying three hidden layers on the German Credit dataset showed an accuracy of 87.19\%, for Kaggle dataset accuracy reached 93.69\%, and for Microcredit dataset accuracy of 97.80\%.},

The critical FinTech applications were evaluated using the hypothetical classic model, which included external influences. The proposed model (urban poor beneficiaries-TAM) was experimentally verified using semi-structured questionnaires and structural equation modelling data. This research shows that attitude has a considerable impact on how fintech apps are meant to be used, outweighing usefulness and risk as factors that directly affect how they are used.

These regulations introduced in 2016 mainly focus on the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms in this country and tend to be negatively associated with firm performance, especially for those firms investing in the P2P lending platforms, as a large amount of P2P lending platforms with unfavourable performance disappear in recent years, which may end up negatively affecting those firms investing in them. Survived P2P lending platforms tend to be stronger, then become a type of substitute of traditional banks and are able to carve up the market share of bank. The latter therefore has to increase credit supply to maximise profits, which leads to the access to more credits and therefore worse firm performance, especially for those firms with financial constraints in terms of the cash?cash flow sensitivity. The empirical results are robust to the potential endogeneity issue of financial constraints. Larger firms and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) tend to have better performance, implying that authorities may take actions for smaller firms (non-SOEs) to offset the negative impacts of financial innovation regulations they suffer and achieve better implementation of financial innovation regulations, which comes to the practical contribution of this paper.},

	abstract = {Abstract The convention of selling on credit (to customers) results in mass accumulation of accounts receivable (AR) on the balance sheet of firms. However, capital-constrained firms do not have enough capital to invest in AR and cover the production cost incurred during the credit period. To finance future business, a capital-constrained firm can employ factoring?a financing scheme wherein firms sell AR to a financial institution (called a factor) at a discount?to advance cash from AR. By formulating a time-continuous model with constant demand over an infinite horizon, we study the factoring policy of firms in two practice-based discounting schemes: automatic discounting and manual discounting. In the automatic discounting scheme, AR should be discounted at the same age, whereas this requirement is relaxed in the manual discounting scheme and how long in advance to discount the AR is contingent over time. In both discounting schemes, the firm needs to choose the timing of discounting in order to reach a capital-unconstrained state as soon as possible. In the automatic discounting scheme, we approximate the firm's objective function with a quasi-convex function whose error is demonstrated to be small. Based on this approximation, the firm's optimal decision and the factor's profit can be calculated more easily. When manual discounting is adopted, the firm should meet all the demand by exploiting factoring if the profit margin under immediate discounting is nonnegative. Given the same factoring discount rate, manual discounting is always more attractive to the firm than automatic discounting. However, the preference of the factor over the two discounting schemes depends on the factoring discount rate.},

The state-of-the-art blockchain designs for P2P energy trading can only support less compute-intensive energy trading tasks and/or rely on the set up of a long challenge time to ensure correctness of transactions, which restricts the systems' scalability and applicability in the diverse P2P energy trading applications. This paper proposes a new dual-blockchain system for P2P energy trading. The system consists of a primary blockchain and a secondary blockchain. The primary blockchain is mainly responsible for storing the data of P2P energy trading transactions while the compute-intensive tasks (e.g. pricing and transaction verification) are executed in the secondary blockchain. An Improved Optimistic Rollup (IOR) mechanism is proposed to facilitate the co-operation of the dual blockchains. Through a specific ?executor-validator? mechanism and a group of specific smart contracts with different functions, the IOR mechanism can effectively accommodate the dual blockchains to execute the P2P energy trading transactions in a computational efficient manner while ensuring the correctness and security of the transactions. A prototype of the proposed system is implemented on Fisco Bcos and Alibaba Cloud and comprehensive simulations are conducted to validate the proposed system.},

	abstract = {Abstract There is a never-ending debate about whether the cap-and-trade mechanism is a valid means of achieving carbon reduction. In this study, we examine it from the perspective of supply chain financing, as the cap-and-trade scheme appears to be an excellent solution to avoid the carbon emission requirements imposed by green credit financing services. We develop a theoretical framework for comparing three distinct kinds of financing modes: bank credit financing, green credit financing, and green credit financing with a cap-and-trade scheme. Based on Stackelberg game with stochastic demand, we then derive optimal outputs for the manufacturer and wholesale prices for the supplier. Counterintuitively, the green credit financing mode is less profitable for manufacturers with low investment in clean production due to stringent carbon emission requirements, yet it is advantageous for the supplier through a higher wholesale price. Conversely, the green credit financing combined with cap-and-trade scheme will result in a different situation in which the manufacturer will benefit from the green credit's lower interest rate, but the cap-and-trade mechanism will diminish the supplier's power in the Stackelberg game and reduce her profits. Finally, from the perspective of social welfare, the green credit financing mode with cap-and-trade scheme will not always benefit for the whole society. Even though it can improve the profit of the manufacturer and consumer surplus, it may lead to higher carbon emission and reduce profits of the supplier when the investment in clean production technology is limited.},

	abstract = {Abstract Financial leverage volatility is a significant factor contributing to the formation of systemic financial risk, which is more apparent in China's fast-growing fintech (financial technology) field. Using the Conditional Value-at-risk approach (?CoVaR) risk metric, the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (Structural Vector Autoregression with Stochastic Volatility model [SV-TVP-SAVR]) model, and the generalized forecast error variance decomposition (Tvpdy) model, this paper discusses how financial leverage volatility shocks fintech sectoral risks and the evolution of the risk within fintech under the shocks on the basis of the classification criteria of the Chinese fintech enterprise database and daily trading data of A-share listed companies. The statistical results show that financial leverage volatility causes risk changes across fintech sectors, which is especially significant during economic downturns or government interventions. Also, under the shock of financial leverage volatility, the fintech sectors will absorb or diffuse risks outward through spillover channels, with significant differences in the risk spillover conditions of different types of sectors. Finally, the fintech sector can produce a contagion system with the Internet consumer finance, payment, and Internet microcommercial credit sectors as the core of risks, resulting in a systemic risk crisis. Our findings have major implications for Chinese regulators to balance financial leverage and prevent systemic risks in the fintech sector.},

Based on fifteen months of fieldwork, this article presents a failed yet influential social experiment of digital finance in the world's largest developing economy. This article examines the morality of the P2P market by observing how the aspirational public script of financial inclusion is maintained and experienced through a hidden technological script that alienates the notion of ?peer.? This article argues that the morality of the market is not only about ?seeing? and judging from a distance but also about ?feeling? and managing the moral boundaries and intersubjective distances between actors. These altered distances restructure interpersonal responsibilities and sustain the dreams and imagination that shape financial subjects on an unconscious level. The article expands the concept of market relationality beyond direct interactions between actors and uncovers the inherent tensions within the dream of financial inclusion. It examines the fantasy of beneficial technology in shaping market morality and the unintended consequences it produces.},

	abstract = {Abstract In recent years, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has been gaining popularity amongst borrowers and individual investors. This can mainly be attributed to the easy and quick access to loans and the higher possible returns. However, the risk involved in these investments is considerable, and for most investors, being nonprofessionals, this increases the complexity and the importance of investment decisions. In this study, we focus on generating optimal investment decisions to lenders for selecting loans. We treat the loan selection process in P2P lending as a portfolio optimization problem, with the aim being to select a set of loans that provide a required return while minimizing risk. In the process, we use internal rate of return as the measure of return. As the starting point of the model, we use machine-learning algorithms to predict the default probabilities and calculate expected values for the loans based on historical data. Afterwards, we calculate the distance between loans using (i) default probabilities and, as a novel step, (ii) expected value. In the calculations, we utilize kernel functions to obtain similarity weights of loans as the input of the optimization models. Two optimization models are tested and compared on data from the popular P2P platform Lending Club. The results show that using the expected-value framework yields higher return.},

	abstract = {Abstract Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks utilize centralized entities (trackers) to assist peers in finding and exchanging information. Although modern P2P protocols are now trackerless and their function relies on distributed hash tables (DHTs), centralized entities are still needed to build file indices (indexing) and assist users in joining DHT swarms (bootstrapping). Although the functionality of these centralized entities are limited, every peer in the network is expected to trust them to function as expected (e.g. to correctly index new files). In this work, a new approach for designing and building decentralized online applications is proposed by introducing DIBDApp. The approach combines blockchain, smart contracts and BitTorrent for building up a combined technology that permits to create decentralized applications that do not require any assistance from centralized entities. DIBDApp is a software library composed of Ethereum smart contracts and an API to the BitTorrent protocol that fully decentralizes indexing, bootstrapping and file storing. DIBDApp enables any peer to seamlessly connect to the designed smart contracts via the Web3J protocol. Extensive experimentation on the Rinkeby Ethereum testnet shows that applications built using the DIBDApp library can perform the same operations as in traditional back-end architectures with a gas cost of a few USD cents.},

We further hypothesize that AON is a costly signal of commitment for entrepreneurs yielding a separate equilibrium with higher quality and more innovative projects with greater success rates.

In this study, we consider the development of optimal contracts for a P2P network by a profit-seeking provider to support the operations of an online file exchange service. By utilizing the principal-agent model of incentive theory, we propose appropriate reward and pricing schemes for profit-seeking P2P content distribution networks. We show that when peers are homogeneous, upload compensation increases with propagation delay uncertainty, maximum uploading nodes allowed, peers' provision cost and disutility of download delay, but decreases with the network size and content availability. We also characterize a general contracting model where there are a countable number of peer classes which are heterogeneous in their provisioning costs. For the case of two peer classes where optimal delays are separable, we derive the optimal upload compensations under different scenarios and show that the impact of operational parameters is quite similar to the case of homogeneous peers, lending support to the robustness of our analysis.},

In collaboration with a large online P2P lending platform, we conduct a randomized field experiment to investigate the effect of social notifications targeted at different contact groups (core-circle and peripheral-circle groups). Our results indicate that notifying social contacts of a delinquent regarding the overdue payment significantly improves the repayment rate. Compared with the control group in which no notification messages are sent to social contacts, notification-triggered social sanctions and social support reduce the default rate by more than 50\% in both core-circle and peripheral-circle groups. Furthermore, we find that social notifications targeted at peripheral-circle social contacts are only effective in the short term, and its effectiveness decreases with repeated use. By contrast, social notifications targeted at core-circle social contacts have a lasting effect.},

This paper attempts to build a decentralized electricity trading scenario within the electricity trading model by introducing blockchain technology, combining the reliability coefficient with both the smart contract and credit value mechanism. Finally, the reliability coefficient and the credit value are introduced into the simulated electricity transaction. The results show that the transaction verification time of the traditional electricity transaction model is 410?seconds at the highest and 330?seconds at the lowest. Meanwhile, the transaction verification time of the blockchain-based distributed power transaction model is 410?seconds at the highest and 300?seconds at the lowest, which means the blockchain-based distributed power transaction has a lower transaction verification time and more efficiency, effectively suppressing the frequency of defaults, reducing the risk of being attacked, and enhancing security.},

	abstract = {Objective In the world of credit, the moving force for a consumer is the credit score. A high credit score will help secure good credit with favorable terms and even a somewhat lower credit score might assist in getting credit, albeit at more costly terms. However, no credit score is likely to be a deterrent to gaining credit. A credit score might also be required to gain services other than financial credit, such as access to a rental property or obtaining certain types of jobs. This is especially problematic for individuals who have insufficient credit information to derive credit scores and who are classified as thin-file individuals. Some maintain that there might be individuals with thin files who are creditworthy despite not having a credit score. This report explores this assertion quantitatively and investigates if there are any identifiable patterns in former thin-file individuals qualifying for credit scores. The study also discusses the use of alternative data to assist in scoring thin-file individuals. Methods We use the Equifax database to follow two samples of thin-file individuals with no credit scores for at least four years in order to develop a timeline indicating when they obtained sufficient credit to qualify for a credit score. Results Our findings document that many individuals with thin files in fact proved to be creditworthy. Some of them even became homeowners. Their eventual credit scores ranged from below 520 to 740 and above. Moreover, most of them qualified for a credit score within three to four years. Furthermore, during this four-year timeframe, the majority received credit scores in the first and second years. Conclusions Even though many individuals with thin files qualify for credit scores within a relatively short period of time, the wait time might be made even shorter if alternative credit data are used to help score them.},

In fact, we combine each of these classifiers with the portfolio optimization problem to understand which combination leads to the best portfolio concerning the risk and return. In order to find the best combined model, numerical studies are conducted based on real-world data. In addition, the performances of these classifiers are evaluated based on different performance measures using the 10-fold cross-validation method. The results indicate that combining the RF algorithm and portfolio optimization problem leads to the least level of risk. Moreover, it is concluded that RF is the best classifier in terms of performance analysis.},

In this paper, we analyse BitTorrent network focusing on the behaviour of shared resources. For that, we develop a monitoring methodology that allows to extract the time evolution of a sample of 1/256 of all the resources shared in the network. As a main difference with previous approaches, our methodology allows to monitor distributed hash table-based BitTorrent networks, that is, without considering trackers. We discuss the data obtained from a monitoring process carried out during 3 months, and as a result, we analyse the information of more than 70?000 resources. This analysis is based on four features: geographic dispersion, popularity, sharing duration and availability. Finally, we show the potential of our methodology by outlining an example application that consists of a detection system intended to identify anomalous behaviours in the sharing of BitTorrent resources.

	abstract = {Summary Portfolios can be managed passively or actively. Passive allocations are investments in an index fund. This management style is attractive because it minimizes trading costs and eliminates most management fees while earning the return on the index. Managers, who believe they can beat the index, presumably because they have superior information or skills, or both, relative to other market participants, on the other hand, make active allocations. Active management can be thought of as shorting the benchmark and going long the active portfolio. The active allocation therefore, generates a return differential, relative to the benchmark, as well as a risk differential, referred to as the active portfolio's tracking error. In addition, active management is important to understand because virtually all managers manage relative to a bogey, that is, some notion of an opportunity cost embodied by a passive portfolio. This chapter describes how active management changes the objective function in the solution to the optimal mean-variance efficient portfolio, how the notion of risk is transformed to tracking error, returns to the notion of risk-adjusted alpha, and the decomposition of risk in active space.},

In recent years, as peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has seen phenomenal growth, leading P2P lending platforms have used various market mechanisms and, in some cases, even switched from one mechanism to another, chasing higher market share and overall growth. While Prosper.com, a leading P2P lending platform, has switched from the auction lending model to a fixed price lending model, recent studies show that overall social welfare was higher with the auction lending model. While the auction lending model gives more power to the lenders, the success of the auction lending model hinges on the accuracy of lenders? assessment of the credit risk of the borrowers. Building on extant literature and in support of the auction lending model to increase social welfare, we design an artifact to dynamically estimate borrower reputation to help the lenders and improve the allocative efficiency in P2P lending markets. We posit that borrowers? reputation built on transactional data, readily available on P2P lending platforms, represents the collective perception of the lenders about the borrowers. We propose a dynamic latent class model of reputation and use the latent instrumental variable approach to deal with endogeneity. We test our artifact using real-world P2P lending data. We show that accounting for reputation improves the model's explanatory power and provides a way to empirically model the evolution and impact of reputation in online platforms where repeated transactions are performed.},

	abstract = {Summary Lending has been around for a very, very long time. In fact, lending pre-dates formal currency and the formalized banking system by, well, thousands of years. Access to lending has today become cheap and ubiquitous. Credit in the form of auto loans, student loans, payday loans, mortgages and credit cards have sprung up across the developed world in increasing variety. Micro credit and lending systems, most recently popularized by the likes of Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and new online social platforms such as Kiva.org, have given broader access to credit in communities that have traditionally not had access to such. One accepted measure of overall credit risk management performance for lending institutions today is default rate, or more specifically expressed as a charge-off rate. In the last 2 to 3 years P2P Lending has improved its viability as a new asset class and maintained respectable default rates.},

	abstract = {Summary This study proposes an investment recommendation model for peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. P2P lenders usually are inexpert, so helping them to make the best decision for their investments is vital. In this study, while we aim to compare the performance of different artificial neural network (ANN) models, we evaluate loans from two perspectives: risk and return. The net present value (NPV) is considered as the return variable. To the best of our knowledge, NPV has been used in few studies in the P2P lending context. Considering the advantages of using NPV, we aim to improve decision-making models in this market by the use of NPV and the integration of supervised learning and optimization algorithms that can be considered as one of our contributions. In order to predict NPV, three ANN models are compared concerning mean square error, mean absolute error, and root-mean-square error to find the optimal ANN model. Furthermore, for the risk evaluation, the probability of default of loans is computed using logistic regression. Investors in the P2P lending market can share their assets between different loans, so the procedure of P2P investment is similar to portfolio optimization. In this context, we minimize the risk of a portfolio for a minimum acceptable level of return. To analyse the effectiveness of our proposed model, we compare our decision-making algorithm with the output of a traditional model. The experimental results on a real-world data set show that our model leads to a better investment concerning both risk and return.},

	abstract = {Abstract Personal credit data usually contain a large number of features, some of which do not significantly contribute to the performance of default prediction models. Screening features through appropriate methods is essential to improve the efficiency of prediction models. However, little attention has been paid to feature selection methods in the area of personal loan default prediction. In this study, we employ random forest (RF), XGBoost, Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) as base algorithms of wrapper and embedded methods to select features and use these algorithms as classifiers to predict personal loan default. We find that when classical filter methods are used to select features, the number of selected features needs to be large enough to enable tree-based classifiers to get their best performance. However, when the tree-based algorithm is used to select features, it only needs to select a small number of features to deliver a satisfactory classification performance. AdaBoost, Chi2, and F-score are found to be ideal feature selection methods in the area of personal credit default prediction. Moreover, we find that it is better to use different algorithms in feature selection and classification; AdaBoost and CatBoost perform the best among all classifiers.},
