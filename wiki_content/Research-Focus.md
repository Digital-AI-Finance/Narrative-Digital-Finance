# Research Focus Areas

The Narrative Digital Finance project spans five interconnected research domains, combining traditional financial analysis with cutting-edge AI and NLP techniques.

---

## 1. Asset Price Bubble Detection

**Objective**: Develop enhanced methods for early detection and prediction of asset price bubbles in financial markets.

### Approach
- Combine econometric models with machine learning techniques
- Integrate narrative analysis from news and social media
- Validate against historical bubble events (2007-08 crisis, COVID sell-off)

### Methods
- GSADF (Generalized Sup Augmented Dickey-Fuller) tests
- LPPLS (Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity) models
- Machine learning classification for bubble identification

### Expected Outcomes
- Early warning systems for asset price bubbles
- Improved prediction accuracy over traditional methods
- Practical tools for regulators and asset managers

## 2. Structural Break Detection

**Objective**: Identify and predict structural breaks in financial time series using hybrid econometric-ML approaches.

### Approach
- Develop AI-enhanced structural break detection models
- Integrate narrative signals to improve detection timing
- Test across multiple asset classes and markets

### Methods
- Change-point detection algorithms
- Regime-switching models
- Neural network-based break detection

### Expected Outcomes
- Earlier detection of market regime changes
- Reduced false positive rates
- Better understanding of break causation

## 3. Narrative Economics & Market Narratives

**Objective**: Quantify and analyze the role of narratives in financial decision-making and market dynamics.

### Approach
- Extract and analyze narratives from financial news, social media, earnings calls
- Study how narratives spread and influence market behavior
- Develop narrative-based market indicators

### Methods
- Topic modeling and narrative extraction
- Sentiment analysis at scale
- Narrative contagion modeling
- Event study methodology

### Key Questions
- How do narratives drive market movements?
- Can narratives predict structural breaks?
- What is the lead-lag relationship between narratives and prices?

### Theoretical Foundation
Building on Robert Shiller's Narrative Economics framework, exploring how economic change depends on social narratives that shape ideas and beliefs.

## 4. High-Frequency Trading & Market Microstructure

**Objective**: Analyze HFT behavior, latency dynamics, and information processing in modern financial markets.

### Approach
- Study reaction times to macroeconomic announcements
- Analyze market microstructure around news events
- Examine the role of algorithms in price discovery

### Collaboration
Joint research with **Deutsche Borse AG** (Dr. Stefan Schlamp)

### Methods
- Granular timestamp analysis
- Latency metric evaluation
- Order flow analysis
- Market maker behavior modeling

### Key Publications
- "Reaction Times to Economic News in High-Frequency Trading" (2025)

### Expected Outcomes
- Understanding of HFT information processing
- Insights into market efficiency and price discovery
- Policy implications for market structure

## 5. Multimodal Finance

**Objective**: Extend financial analysis beyond text to incorporate images, video, and audio data.

### Approach
- Develop frameworks for analyzing non-textual financial data
- Apply Generative AI to expand analytical capabilities
- Integrate multimodal signals for market prediction

### Data Types
- **Text**: News, social media, earnings transcripts
- **Images**: Charts, company logos, satellite imagery
- **Video**: CEO interviews, earnings webcasts
- **Audio**: Tone analysis, speech patterns

### Methods
- Multimodal deep learning architectures
- Vision-language models
- Audio sentiment analysis
- Generative AI for data augmentation

### Key Publications
- "Hypothesizing Multimodal Influence" (SSRN, 2024)

### Future Directions
- Integration with real-time trading systems
- Cross-modal learning for financial prediction
- Applications in ESG and alternative data

## Research Integration

These five focus areas are deeply interconnected:

```
Narrative Economics <---> Asset Price Bubbles
        |                        |
        v                        v
Structural Breaks <---> Market Microstructure
                  \      /
                   v    v
             Multimodal Finance
```

The project aims to develop a unified framework that leverages insights across all domains to create more robust and predictive financial models.
