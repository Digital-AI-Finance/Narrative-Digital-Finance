## Project Overview

Large fluctuations, instabilities, trends and uncertainty of financial markets constitute a substantial challenge for asset management companies, pension funds and regulators. This project develops a comprehensive framework that utilizes advanced machine learning and NLP techniques to predict market outcomes, detect asset price bubbles, and identify structural breaks.

### Research Focus Areas

1. **Asset Price Bubble Detection** - ML-enhanced bubble prediction
2. **Structural Break Detection** - Hybrid econometric-AI methods
3. **Narrative Economics** - Market narrative analysis
4. **High-Frequency Trading** - Market microstructure (with Deutsche Borse)
5. **Multimodal Finance** - Text, image, audio analysis
