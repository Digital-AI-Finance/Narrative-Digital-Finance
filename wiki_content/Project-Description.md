# Project Description

## Narrative Digital Finance: A tale of structural breaks, bubbles & market narratives

Research Project of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)

**Grant Number**: IZCOZ0-213370

---

## Background

Large fluctuations, instabilities, trends and uncertainty of financial markets constitute a substantial challenge for asset management companies, pension funds and regulators. Nowadays, most asset management companies and financial institutions follow a so-called systematic trading approach in their investment decisions. Systematic trading refers to applying predefined, rule-based trading strategies for buy- and sell orders.

However, automated or rules-based trading activities bring certain risks for market participants and the whole financial market. In times of increased market volatility, market turmoil or so-called market sell-offs, investors applying similar trading rules might undertake the same actions, escalating and increasing systemic market risk through such behavior.

### Historical Examples

Such situations have been frequently observed on financial markets:
- **March 2020**: Sell-off related to the Covid pandemic
- **2010-2012**: European Sovereign Debt crisis
- **2007-08**: Global financial crisis

## Rationale

Despite advancements in econometric methods, the detection of asset price bubbles and structural breaks remains uncertain and underexplored, particularly in the context of classic financial assets. Recent research underscores the powerful role of narratives in financial decision-making, suggesting that integrating textual analysis could enhance market understanding and prediction accuracy.

### Theoretical Foundation

Building on Robert Shiller's work in Narrative Economics, which demonstrates that "economic change depends to a great extent on social narratives that shape ideas and beliefs," this project investigates the mechanisms linking narratives, actions, and market outcomes.

---

## Overall Objectives

The project aims to develop a comprehensive framework that utilizes advanced machine learning and NLP techniques to:
- Predict market outcomes
- Detect asset price bubbles
- Identify structural breaks
- Leverage diverse data sources, including financial data and narrative content from text, speech, and multimedia

---

## Specific Aims

The project has three main goals:

### Aim 1: Econometric Model Validation
**Validate and refine existing econometric models** using real-world financial data
- Test GSADF and LPPLS models on historical data
- Benchmark against known bubble events
- Develop improved detection algorithms

### Aim 2: Narrative Integration
**Integrate narrative analysis** to understand and predict market behaviors and asset price dynamics
- Extract and quantify market narratives
- Study narrative contagion and market impact
- Develop narrative-based indicators

### Aim 3: AI/ML Framework Development
**Create a multidimensional AI and ML framework** that enhances the detection of market anomalies and forecasts financial trends
- Combine traditional analysis with NLP insights
- Develop hybrid econometric-ML models
- Create practical prediction tools

---

## Methods

The approach involves multiple methodological streams:

### Data Collection
Collecting and processing a wide range of data, including:
- Stock prices and market indices
- Macroeconomic indicators
- Textual content from the web (news, social media)
- High-frequency trading data (in collaboration with Deutsche Borse)
- Alternative data sources

### Text Analysis
Employing text mining and NLP techniques to analyze:
- Sentiment (lexicon-based and deep learning)
- Narrative structures and story arcs
- Topic dynamics over time
- Impact on market movements

### AI Model Development
Developing and testing new AI models that combine traditional financial analysis with narrative insights to:
- Predict market changes
- Detect structural breaks
- Identify bubble formation
- Analyze multimodal financial data

## Expected Results

The project is expected to yield:

### 1. Enhanced Prediction Models
For financial markets with greater accuracy, especially in detecting asset price bubbles and structural breaks

### 2. Novel Datasets
And measurement techniques that provide deeper insights into the interplay between market narratives and financial indicators

### 3. Practical Tools
For asset management and regulatory bodies to better anticipate and react to market crises

### 4. Theoretical Contributions
Advancing understanding of narrative economics in quantitative finance

## Impact for the Field

This research could significantly transform how financial markets are understood and modeled. It aims to bridge the gap between traditional econometric approaches and modern AI techniques, providing new insights into the role of narratives and quantitative data in financial decision-making.

The results are anticipated to offer valuable tools for:
- **Risk Management**: Early warning systems for market crises
- **Asset Pricing**: Improved valuation models incorporating narrative signals
- **Trading Strategies**: Novel signals for systematic trading
- **Policy & Regulation**: Tools for monitoring systemic risk

This approach is particularly relevant in understanding the complexities of today's non-linear, dynamic financial markets, enhancing the robustness of financial models against future economic crises.
