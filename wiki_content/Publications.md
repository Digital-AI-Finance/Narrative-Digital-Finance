#### 1. TOPol: Capturing and Explaining Multidimensional Semantic Polarity Fields and Vectors

| | |
|---|---|
| Authors | Taibi, Gabin; Gomez, Luis |
| Year | 2025 |
| Status | Working paper |
| Repository | [OSF](https://osf.io/nr94j/) |

**Abstract**

Semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing multidimensional semantic polarity fields using transformer embeddings, UMAP projection, and Leiden clustering. Moves beyond traditional unidimensional sentiment scoring to capture the full complexity of financial narratives.

**Work Package**: WP1 (Text Data & Text Analytics), WP3 (Narratives for Structural Breaks)

#### 2. AI-Enhanced Systematic Literature Review on Financial Narratives

| | |
|---|---|
| Authors | Taibi, Gabin et al. |
| Year | 2025 |
| Status | Under revision at Financial Innovation |

**Abstract**

Systematic literature review using NLP techniques, clustering algorithms, and interpretability tools. Applies algorithmic selection to Scopus peer-reviewed literature, identifying research practices for modeling financial narratives with NLP methods.

**Work Package**: WP1 (Text Data & Text Analytics)

#### 3. Nanosecond Microstructure: High-Frequency Traders Participation Stylized Facts

| | |
|---|---|
| Authors | Taibi, Gabin; Osterrieder, Joerg; Schlamp, Stefan |
| Year | 2025 |
| Status | Working paper |

**Abstract**

Novel methodology for classifying market participants based on nanosecond-level reaction times. Distinguishes Ultra-Fast Traders (UFT, <1 microsecond using FPGAs), High-Frequency Traders (HFT, 1-10 microseconds), and conventional participants using Deutsche Borse T7 platform data.

**Work Package**: WP4 (Multidimensional AI and ML Solutions)

#### 4. Reaction Times to Economic News in High-Frequency Trading

| | |
|---|---|
| Authors | Osterrieder, Joerg; Schlamp, Stefan |
| Year | 2025 |
| Published in | SSRN |
| SSRN ID | 5112295 |
| Link | [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5112295) |

**Abstract**

Examines granular timestamp data and latency metrics to evaluate immediate market responses to pivotal announcements (PMI, NFP, FOMC). Reveals HFT systems exhibit remarkably low latencies in response to specific macroeconomic releases.

**Work Package**: WP4 (Multidimensional AI and ML Solutions)

### 2024

#### 5. Hypothesizing Multimodal Influence: Assessing the Impact of Textual and Non-Textual Data on Financial Instrument Pricing

| | |
|---|---|
| Authors | Bolesta, Karolina; Taibi, Gabin; Mare, Codruta; Osterrieder, Joerg; Hopp, Christian |

| SSRN ID | 4698153 |
| Link | [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4698153) |

**Abstract**

Extends traditional NLP to include non-textual data (images, video, audio) for financial instrument pricing using Generative AI. Acknowledges exponential growth of multimodal data requiring comprehensive analysis approaches.

**Work Package**: WP3 (Narratives for Structural Breaks)
