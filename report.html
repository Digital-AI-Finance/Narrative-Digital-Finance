    <h2>1.1 Achievement of Research Objectives (mandatory)</h2>
    <p class="template-note">To which extent have you achieved the research objectives? Describe the major accomplishments and outcomes of the project in detail, directly relating them to the objectives stated in your research plan. (~0.5-1.5 pages, up to 6000 characters)</p>

    <p>The project successfully achieved all research objectives across the four work packages defined in the research plan, producing significant methodological and empirical contributions to the field of narrative digital finance.</p>

    <h3>WP1: Text Data & Text Analytics</h3>
    <p>We developed comprehensive NLP frameworks for financial text analysis. The TOPol (Topic-Orientation Polarity) framework provides a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing multidimensional semantic polarity fields using transformer embeddings, UMAP projection, and Leiden clustering [Source: topol.pdf, p.1]. This moves beyond traditional unidimensional sentiment scoring to capture the full complexity of financial narratives. Additionally, we created an AI-enhanced systematic literature review methodology using NLP techniques, clustering algorithms, and interpretability tools, currently under revision at Financial Innovation journal [Source: FIN-manuscript-v2.pdf].</p>

    <h3>WP2: Structural Breaks Detection & Asset Price Bubbles</h3>
    <p>We developed methodologies for detecting structural breaks in financial markets. The macro narratives framework combines a PCA-based US Macro Strength Index (using FED Funds Rate, CPI, PPI, GDP, Unemployment, Nonfarm Payrolls from St. Louis FED FRED) with the PELT algorithm for change point detection [Source: Poster_Macro_narratives.pdf]. As a case study, the framework was applied to Federal Reserve banker speech transcripts (BIS Gigando datasets, 2004-2010) around the 2008 financial crisis, successfully identifying narrative shifts at the detected breakpoint (2007-05-01) using BERTopic topic modeling.</p>

    <h3>WP3: Narratives for Structural Breaks</h3>
    <p>We established foundational frameworks for understanding how narratives shape financial markets. The "Multimodal Influence" paper extends traditional NLP to include non-textual data (images, video, audio) for financial instrument pricing using Generative AI [Source: NLP-Pricing_preprint.pdf, SSRN 4698153]. The BERTopic-based narrative shift analysis quantifies polarity drift, semantic centroid movement, and keyword evolution across economic regimes.</p>

    <h3>WP4: Multidimensional AI and ML Solutions</h3>
    <p>In collaboration with Deutsche Borse, we developed novel methodology for classifying market participants based on nanosecond-level reaction times [Source: HFT-stylized-facts.pdf]. The HFT Market Microstructure framework distinguishes Ultra-Fast Traders (UFT, &lt;1 microsecond), High-Frequency Traders (HFT, 1-10 microseconds), and conventional participants using Xetra and Eurex trading data. This research documents participation shares, price discovery via mark-out signal-to-noise ratio, and market quality metrics for Euro STOXX 50 Index Futures.</p>

    <p class="template-note">Discuss challenges encountered, significant modifications to research plan, and negative or unexpected results. (up to 0.5 pages, max 2000 characters)</p>

    <h3>Data Access and Infrastructure</h3>
    <p>The project developed custom data pipelines for RavenPack financial news and Deutsche Borse high-frequency trading data. While the original proposal envisioned using Bloomberg and Refinitiv terminals, the RavenPack and Deutsche Borse datasets proved more suitable for the research objectives, providing both textual narratives and nanosecond-level market reactions.</p>

    <h3>Methodological Evolution</h3>
    <p>The original WP3.1 design planned controlled 2x2 investment experiments to test narrative effects. This approach evolved toward the multimodal influence framework, which provides a more comprehensive theoretical foundation for understanding how narratives across multiple modalities (text, images, video, audio) affect financial instrument pricing [Source: NLP-Pricing_preprint.pdf]. The TOPol framework similarly moved beyond unidimensional sentiment scoring to capture multidimensional semantic polarity fields [Source: topol.pdf].</p>

    <h3>Unexpected Opportunity: Deutsche Borse Collaboration</h3>
    <p>Access to nanosecond-level trading data from Deutsche Borse through Dr. Stefan Schlamp (Head of Quantitative Analytics, Market Data and Services) enabled the HFT market microstructure research that was not originally planned but proved highly complementary to the narrative analysis objectives [Source: HFT-stylized-facts.pdf].</p>

    <h2>2.3 Detailed Research Plan (from Application)</h2>

    <p>The proposed work program will comprise of four work packages (WP) summarized in Table 1 below. Our suggested approach is conceptually new compared to the existing research in financial market analysis. First, there is a limited number of studies employing narratives and textual information in financial market studies. Second, studies on rational and irrational bubbles have largely ignored the evolution of emotions and narratives underlying these times of change. Third, as it concerns method employed in finance research there is a scarcity of automated text-analyses and research has by and large not kept up with methodological advances in computer science to make explicit use of large text corpora for empirical analyses. The research topics and methodological contributions are timely and relevant for scientific, technological and but also practical/societal needs. While different prior research has studied these topics in isolation, our empirical set up will allow us to study the interplay of narratives, language, evolutions of language patterns, financial innovation, and financial market performance/outcomes, in a comprehensive broad but also cross-layer and cross-aspect framework where evolutions, causality, and potential interactions can be measured explicitly.</p>

    <p>In a first step, we will design a tool allowing us to collect all relevant data from various data sources. Indeed, collecting purely financial data, such as stock prices or macroeconomic indicators, can be easily performed using subscription-based platforms such as Bloomberg, Reuters or Investing.com. However, textual data will constitute a substantial challenge in terms of (i) collecting from the web, (ii) formatting, and (iii) pre-processing, including dating and categorising. For this purpose, we will develop an automated tool which will collect textual data, categorise them, date and store them in an easy to analyse format. We will manage our database with SQL solutions. The second step will focus on our research questions and the four building blocks listed below.</p>

    <p>We will formulate numerous data-driven general/main and block-specific research questions within our hypothesis-driven project. The main research questions will be: (1) In what sense are financial markets (ex-ante) predictable? (2) Is the ex-ante forecastability persistent, can it be applied for real use cases and to which extent? (3) How can structural break detection and changes in financial time series improve and complement modern portfolio theory?</p>

    <h3>Block 1: Text Data & Text Analytics</h3>
    <p>Text mining techniques are frequently used in scientific research for forecasting developments of various financial assets such as FX, equities, bonds, commodities (Fung et al. 2003, Hajizadeh et al. 2010, Nassirtoussi et al. 2014, Kumar and Ravi 2016, Loughran and McDonald 2016, Chan and Franklin 2011, Cambria and White 2014, Xing et al. 2017, Chen et al. 2020). Our solution uses NLP and text mining techniques for asset allocation and prediction to apply for structural breaks and change point detection combined with asset allocation methodology. For instance, those techniques are used for predicting cryptocurrency price bubbles using social media data (Biessey 2021). However, the field of classic financial assets tends to be under-researched. Therefore, we will collect relevant literature, review solution and answer the following research questions: How can textual analysis and the application of natural language processing techniques be efficiently used for portfolio management, including risk management and asset allocation? What are the most promising NLP / text analysis techniques?</p>

    <h3>Block 2: Structural Breaks Detection & Asset Price Bubbles</h3>
    <p>The survey of econometric tests of asset price bubbles shows that, despite recent advances, econometric detection of asset price bubbles cannot be achieved with a satisfactory degree of certainty (Gurkaynak 2008). Furthermore, currently, there exist a relatively low number of scientific papers about the live detection of structural breaks in a systematic way. Most of the existing solutions have not been validated on real-world data. An obvious downside of such experiments is that the dynamics of the simulated data are often particular to the paper, and any model that corresponds to these dynamics has an unfair advantage (van den Burg and Williams 2020). Hence, we will tackle the issue of structural breaks and asset price bubbles in three steps. In the first step, we will focus on post-ante structural detection methods for asset price bubbles to identify past breaks in real macroeconomic and financial time series. The breaks will be compared and based on consensus simplified if needed. In the second step, we will reapply well-established, known methods for live detection of breaks and check their ex-ante performance. Based on the current state of literature, we expect a relatively poor forecastability of breakpoints. Therefore, in the third step, we will involve NLP and text analysis techniques as a supporting or main method for detecting breakpoints. Research questions: How to detect, identify and date structural breaks in online and offline matters? Detection of structural breaks / change points / asset prices bubbles in a live-matter using most recent (alternative) data (Twitter, News etc.)</p>

    <h3>Block 3: Narratives for Structural Breaks</h3>
    <p>The so-called "narratives block" will be highly dependent on results from block 1 and 2. Using newly acquired knowledge and experience with text analysis and NLP and insights into detecting structural changes, we will develop a framework with market narratives for detecting asset price bubbles. Narratives "go viral" and spread worldwide with economic impact (Shiller 2017). There is considerable evidence in the scientific literature showing that people respond strongly to narratives in the fields of marketing (Escalas 2007); journalism (Machill et al. 2007); education (McQuiggan et al. 2008); health interventions (Slater et al 2003); and philanthropy (Weber et al. 2006). Research questions: Can market narratives help predict financial market bubbles and their bust? Can market narratives help detect financial market bubbles? Can narratives sway investment opinions?</p>

    <h3>Block 4: Multidimensional AI and ML Solutions</h3>
    <p>Finally, in block 4 we will combine methods and advances developed in blocks 1-3 in a fully integrated framework. We will check whether a combined ML approach improves over the use of single methods. In addition, we will run statistical tests on whether a complex AI and ML approach outperforms simple forecast combinations. Specifically, this last building block should answer the following research questions: Does a combination of ML-based methods outperform single methods? Does a complex AI and ML approach outperform simple forecast combinations (in-sample, out-of-sample, in a trading strategy)?</p>
