    <h2>1.1 Achievement of Research Objectives</h2>
    <p class="char-count">5,369 / 6,000 characters</p>
    <p>The project successfully achieved all research objectives across the four work packages defined in the research plan, producing significant methodological and empirical contributions to the field of narrative digital finance.</p>
    <h3>WP1</h3>
    <p>Text Data & Text Analytics
We developed comprehensive NLP frameworks for financial text analysis. The TOPol (Topic-Orientation Polarity) framework provides a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing multidimensional semantic polarity fields using transformer embeddings, UMAP projection, and Leiden clustering. This moves beyond traditional unidimensional sentiment scoring to capture the full complexity of financial narratives. TOPol begins by embedding documents using a general-purpose transformer-based LLM, followed by neighbor-tuned UMAP projection and topic-based segmentation via Leiden partitioning. Given a contextual boundary between regimes A and B, the framework computes directional vectors between corresponding topic-boundary centroids, producing a polarity field that captures fine-grained semantic displacement. The framework generates contrastive labels with estimated coverage to interpret identified polarity shifts. Code and data are publicly available at OSF (osf.io/nr94j). Additionally, we created an AI-enhanced systematic literature review methodology using NLP techniques, clustering algorithms, and interpretability tools, currently under revision at Financial Innovation journal. This SLR applies algorithmic selection to Scopus peer-reviewed literature, identifying research practices for modeling financial narratives with NLP methods.</p>
    <h3>WP2</h3>
    <p>Structural Breaks Detection & Asset Price Bubbles
We developed methodologies for detecting structural breaks in financial markets. The macro narratives framework combines a PCA-based US Macro Strength Index (using FED Funds Rate, CPI, PPI, GDP, Unemployment, Nonfarm Payrolls from St. Louis FED FRED, 1996-2025) with the PELT algorithm for change point detection. The first principal component explains the largest share of variance and captures joint dynamics in growth, inflation, and labor conditions. As a case study, the framework was applied to Federal Reserve banker speech transcripts (BIS Gigando datasets, 2004-2010) around the 2008 financial crisis, successfully identifying narrative shifts at the detected breakpoint (2007-05-01) using BERTopic. Null hypothesis testing via 1000 random shuffling simulations validated statistical significance of observed polarity drift, semantic centroid movement, and keyword evolution. Related prework on NFT bubble detection (Wang et al., 2022, Journal of Chinese Economic and Business Studies) has been extended for PhD research.</p>
    <h3>WP3</h3>
    <p>Narratives for Structural Breaks
We established foundational frameworks for understanding how narratives shape financial markets. The Multimodal Influence paper (SSRN 4698153) extends traditional NLP to include non-textual data (images, video, audio) for financial instrument pricing using Generative AI. This research acknowledges the exponential growth from a few dozen exabytes in 2003 to approximately 180 zettabytes by 2025, requiring multimodal analysis approaches. The BERTopic-based narrative shift analysis quantifies polarity drift (FinBERT sentiment), semantic centroid movement (cosine similarity between topic centroids), and keyword evolution (Jaccard similarity of Maximal Marginal Relevance keyword sets) across economic regimes. Word clouds aggregate MMR keywords from all topics before and after breakpoints, visualizing thematic drift across narrative regimes.</p>
    <h3>WP4</h3>
    <p>Multidimensional AI and ML Solutions
In collaboration with Deutsche Borse, we developed novel methodology for classifying market participants based on nanosecond-level reaction times. The HFT Market Microstructure framework uses nanosecond-level timestamp data from Deutsche Borse's T7 platform to distinguish Ultra-Fast Traders (UFT, <1 microsecond), High-Frequency Traders (HFT, 1-10 microseconds), and conventional participants (>10 microseconds). UFTs rely on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for ultra-low-latency execution. Research documents participation shares (UFT/HFT produce roughly 20% of total participation), price discovery via 15-second mark-out signal-to-noise ratio, and market quality metrics including order-imbalance volatility, Amihud illiquidity, and high-frequency return diagnostics (autocorrelation, variance-ratio tests) for Euro STOXX 50 Index Futures (FESX) from January to August 2025.</p>
    <h3>Key Publications</h3>
    <p>TOPol Semantic Polarity Fields (Taibi, Gomez, 2025); SLR on Financial Narratives (Taibi et al., 2025, under revision at Financial Innovation); Nanosecond Microstructure: HFT Participation Stylized Facts (Taibi, Osterrieder, Schlamp, 2025); Reaction Times to Economic News in HFT (Osterrieder, Schlamp, 2025, SSRN 5112295); Macro Narratives & Fed Communication (Taibi, 2025, conference poster); Multimodal Influence (Bolesta, Taibi et al., 2024, SSRN 4698153).</p>
    <h3>Data Infrastructure</h3>
    <p>Custom Python pipelines for data ingestion from RavenPack (news headlines), LSEG (earnings call transcripts), BIS (central bank speeches), SEC EDGAR (10-K/10-Q filings), and Deutsche Borse (nanosecond-level Xetra/Eurex trading data). The realized-library provides efficient Python and C++ implementations for realized volatility estimators and jump detection.</p>

<div class="section" id="section-1-2">
    <h2>1.2 Challenges, Negative Results and Unexpected Outcomes</h2>
    <p class="char-count">1,462 / 2,000 characters</p>
    <h3>Data Access and Infrastructure
The project developed custom data pipelines for RavenPack financial news, LSEG earnings transcripts, BIS central bank speeches, SEC EDGAR filings (10-K, 10-Q), and Deutsche Borse high-frequency trading data. While the original proposal envisioned using Bloomberg and Refinitiv terminals, these alternative sources proved more suitable for the research objectives, providing both textual narratives and nanosecond-level market reactions.</h3>
    <h3>Methodological Evolution
The original WP3.1 design planned controlled 2x2 investment experiments to test narrative effects. This approach evolved toward the multimodal influence framework (SSRN 4698153), providing a more comprehensive theoretical foundation for understanding how narratives across multiple modalities (text, images, video, audio) affect financial instrument pricing. The TOPol framework similarly moved beyond unidimensional sentiment scoring to capture multidimensional semantic polarity fields through transformer embeddings and Leiden clustering.</h3>
    <h3>Unexpected Opportunity</h3>
    <p>Deutsche Borse Collaboration
Access to nanosecond-level trading data from Deutsche Borse through Dr. Stefan Schlamp (Head of Quantitative Analytics, Market Data and Services) enabled complementary HFT market microstructure research, analyzing Euro STOXX 50 Index Futures from the T7 platform. This collaboration began January 2024 and produced joint publications on UFT/HFT classification methodology.</p>

    <h2>1.3 Contribution to Knowledge Advancement</h2>
    <p class="char-count">1,770 / 2,000 characters</p>
    <p>This research bridges narrative economics (Shiller, 2017, 2019) with computational linguistics and financial econometrics, providing quantitative tools for analyzing how stories and interpretations influence market dynamics and volatility regimes. The work addresses a fundamental question: how do forms of narratives influence volatility and regime changes in financial markets?</p>
    <p><strong>TOPol Framework:</strong> First semi-unsupervised framework for multidimensional semantic polarity in financial texts, moving beyond unidimensional sentiment scoring to capture narrative complexity through transformer embeddings, UMAP projection, and Leiden clustering. The vectorial representation enables quantification of the magnitude, direction, and semantic meaning of polarity shifts across discourse regime changes.</p>
    <p><strong>Macro-Narrative Integration:</strong> Novel combination of PCA-based macroeconomic indices (US Macro Strength Index from FRED data) with BERTopic topic modeling for detecting narrative regime shifts. Null hypothesis testing via 1000 random shuffling simulations validates statistical significance.</p>
    <p><strong>HFT Classification:</strong> New methodology using nanosecond latency thresholds to distinguish UFT (<1 microsecond, FPGA-based), HFT (1-10 microseconds), and conventional market participants (>10 microseconds), with documented participation shares, price discovery metrics, and market quality indicators.</p>
    <p><strong>SLR Methodology:</strong> AI-enhanced systematic literature review framework using NLP techniques, clustering algorithms, and interpretability tools for reproducible, efficient research synthesis.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact Areas:</strong> Narrative Economics, Central Bank Communication Analysis, Market Microstructure, Volatility Regime Detection, NLP in Finance, High-Frequency Trading Research, Asset Bubble Detection.</p>
